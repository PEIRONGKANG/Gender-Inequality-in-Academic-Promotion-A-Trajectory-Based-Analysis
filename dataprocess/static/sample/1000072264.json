Toward the goals of improving the aggressive course and poor prognosis of CCS, and establish new therapeutic methods, molecular genetic and biological characterizations of CCS are required.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nA new human CCS cell line (designated RSAR001) was established from the pleural effusion of a 44-year-old man with multiple lung metastases and pleural dissemination. The cell line and its xenograft were characterized including their morphology, immunohistochemistry, cytogenetic analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis.\n\nRESULTS:\nThe cell line has been maintained for over 12 months with more than 50 passages. RSAR001 cells exhibited a fascicular or diffuse growth pattern of short spindle- or oval-shaped cells with clear cytoplasm in heterotransplanted tumor, that was similar to the primary tumor. Immunophenotypically, RSAR001 cells in vitro and in vivo exhibited almost the same characteristics as the primary tumor. Cytogenetic analyses revealed a translocation, t(12;22)(q13;q12). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing analysis detected transcripts of the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-activating transcription factor 1 (EWSR1-ATF1) type 1 fusion gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using a break-apart probe for the EWSR1 gene on 22q12 showed a rearrangement.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThese findings indicate that the RSAR001 cell line harbors EWSR1-ATF1 type 1 chimeric fusion gene, which is specific to CCS.

Toward the goals of improving the aggressive course and poor prognosis of CCS, and establish new therapeutic methods, molecular genetic and biological characterizations of CCS are required.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nA new human CCS cell line (designated RSAR001) was established from the pleural effusion of a 44-year-old man with multiple lung metastases and pleural dissemination. The cell line and its xenograft were characterized including their morphology, immunohistochemistry, cytogenetic analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis.\n\nRESULTS:\nThe cell line has been maintained for over 12 months with more than 50 passages. RSAR001 cells exhibited a fascicular or diffuse growth pattern of short spindle- or oval-shaped cells with clear cytoplasm in heterotransplanted tumor, that was similar to the primary tumor. Immunophenotypically, RSAR001 cells in vitro and in vivo exhibited almost the same characteristics as the primary tumor. Cytogenetic analyses revealed a translocation, t(12;22)(q13;q12). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing analysis detected transcripts of the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-activating transcription factor 1 (EWSR1-ATF1) type 1 fusion gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using a break-apart probe for the EWSR1 gene on 22q12 showed a rearrangement.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThese findings indicate that the RSAR001 cell line harbors EWSR1-ATF1 type 1 chimeric fusion gene, which is specific to CCS. RSAR001 cells might be useful for investigating biological behaviors and developing new treatments such as molecular-targeting antitumor drugs or immunological drugs for CCS."

                        "en": "Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients with tumors that harbor no targetable driver gene mutation, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, have unfavorable prognosis, and thus, novel therapeutic targets are required. Family with sequence similarity 83, member B (FAM83B) is a biomarker for squamous cell lung cancer. FAM83B has also recently been shown to serve an important role in the EGFR signaling pathway. In the present study, the molecular and clinical impact of FAM83B in lung ADC was investigated. Matched tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples were obtained from 216 patients who underwent complete lung resection for primary lung ADC and were examined for FAM83B expression using cDNA microarray analysis. The associations between FAM83B expression and clinicopathological parameters, including patient survival, were examined. FAM83B was highly expressed in tumors from males, smokers and in tumors with wild-type EGFR. Multivariate analyses further confirmed that wild-type EGFR tumors were significantly positively associated with FAM83B expression. In survival analysis, FAM83B expression was associated with poor outcomes in disease-free survival and overall survival, particularly when stratified against tumors with wild-type EGFR. Furthermore, FAM83B knockdown was performed to investigate its phenotypic effect on lung ADC cell lines. Gene silencing by FAM83B RNA interference induced growth suppression in the HLC-1 and H1975 lung ADC cell lines. FAM83B may be involved in lung ADC tumor proliferation and can be a predictor of poor survival. FAM83B is also a potential novel therapeutic target for ADC with wild-type EGFR."

                        "en": "Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (BSCE) is a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma that is difficult to distinguish from other carcinomas by preoperative endoscopic biopsy because of its histological varieties. Accurate diagnosis is essential for adequate treatment, and the methods proposed so far (e.g., immunohistochemical staining) have limitations. In this study, we tried to identify the characteristic bundles of gene expression in BSCE using comprehensive gene expression analysis (CGEA). Subsequently, we constructed a gene expression scoring system for the proper diagnosis of BSCE. Fifty-seven surgical specimens, including seven BSCEs, obtained from 30 patients who underwent esophagectomy were used for constructing the scoring system. Three hundred and twelve biopsy specimens, including eight BSCEs, obtained from 80 patients and 20 commercially available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens diagnosed as esophageal cancer, including 13 BSCEs, were used for validation. After our original mathematical extraction algorithm, 75 genes were extracted to distinguish BSCE from non-BSCE. The cumulative converted values (gene expression score) of the respective 75 genes from each specimen were obtained and lined up in ascending order to assess the optimal gene expression cut-off score for a definitive diagnosis of BSCE. The validation of this scoring system showed high prediction of the biopsy specimens [area under the curve (AUC)=0.981; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.952-1.000] and the commercially available FFPE specimens (AUC=0.901; 95% CI: 0.750-1.000). In conclusion, using CGEA in a gene expression scoring system helps in differentiating BSCE from non-BSCE with high accuracy and may contribute in improving BSCE treatment."

                        "en": "Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS) is an autosomal recessive form of early-onset parkinsonism linked to the PARK9 locus. The causative gene for KRS is Atp13a2, which encodes a lysosomal type 5 P-type ATPase. We recently showed that KRS/PARK9-linked mutations lead to several lysosomal alterations, including reduced proteolytic processing of cathepsin D in vitro. However, it remains unknown how deficiency of Atp13a2 is connected to lysosomal impairments. To address this issue, we analyzed brain tissues of Atp13a2 conditional-knockout mice, which exhibited characteristic features of neuronal ceroid Lipofuscinosis, including accumulation of Lipofuscin positive for subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase, suggesting that a common pathogenic mechanism underlies both neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and Parkinson disease."

                        "en": "Personalized therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma, has recently been significantly improved by the discovery of various molecular targets. However, this has not been the case for lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In the present study, we identified the family with sequence similarity 83, member B (FAM83B) as a candidate marker for SCC through a comprehensive gene expression analysis and examined its correlations with various clinicopathological factors. The subjects of this study consisted of 215 patients with NSCLC who underwent complete resection from 2005 to 2011 at the Fukushima Medical University Hospital (Fukushima, Japan). They included 102 patients with adenocarcinoma and 113 with SCC. FAM83B expression was first examined in some of the samples by gene expression analysis and western blotting, and then all clinical specimens were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The relationship between the quantitative values for IHC and clinicopathological factors was statistically analyzed. The results showed that FAM83B mRNA expression was significantly higher in SCC than in normal lung or adenocarcinoma (P&lt;0.0001). Immunoblot analysis also confirmed this trend. Specimens containing &gt;10% positive area for FAM83B were judged as 'positive'; 94.3% (107/113) of SCC and 14.7% (15/102) of adenocarcinoma were positive. Patients were divided into two subgroups according to expression (54 high-expression and 53 low-expression patients); the high-expression group was associated with a better disease-free survival (DFS) rate (P=0.042, log-rank test). In conclusion, FAM83B may be a reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for SCC. Detailed analyses of FAM83B function in lung cancer are required to understand how its expression is associated with better prognosis in SCC."

                        "en": "It has been well established that a starvation-induced decrease in insulin/IGF-I and serum amino acids effectively suppresses the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) signaling to induce autophagy, which is a major degradative cellular pathway in skeletal muscles. In this study, we investigated the systematic effects of exercise on the mTor signaling of skeletal muscles. Wild type C57BL/6J mice were starved for 24 h under synchronous autophagy induction conditions. Under these conditions, endogenous LC3-II increased, while both S6-kinse and S6 ribosomal protein were dephosphorylated in the skeletal muscles, which indicated mTor inactivation. Using GFP-LC3 transgenic mice, it was also confirmed that fluorescent GFP-LC3 dots in the skeletal muscles increased, including soleus, plantaris, and gastrocnemius, which clearly showed autophagosomal induction. These starved mice were then subjected to a single bout of running on a treadmill (12 m/min, 2 h, with a lean of 10 degrees). Surprisingly, biochemical analyses revealed that the exercise elicited a decrease in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio as well as an inversion from the dephosphorylated state to the rephosphorylated state of S6-kinase and ribosomal S6 in these skeletal muscles. Consistently, the GFP-LC3 dots of the skeletal muscles were diminished immediately after the exercise. These results indicated that exercise suppressed starvation-induced autophagy through a reactivation of mTor signaling in the skeletal muscles of these starved mice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

                        "en": "Cathepsin C (CC) (EC 3.4.14.1, dipeptidyl peptidase I) is a lysosomal cysteine protease that is required for the activation of several granule-associated serine proteases in vivo. CC has been shown to be constitutively expressed in various tissues, but the enzyme is hardly detectable in central nervous system (CNS) tissues. In the present study, we investigated the regional and cellular distribution of CC in normal, aging and pathological mouse brains. Immunoblotting failed to detect CC protein in whole brain tissues of normal mice, as previously described. However, low proteolytic activity of CC was detected in a brain region-dependent manner, and granular immunohistochemical signals were found in neuronal perikarya of particular brain regions, including the accessory olfactory bulb, the septum, CA2 of the hippocampus, a part of the cerebral cortex, the medial geniculate, and the inferior colliculus. In aged mice, the number of CC-positive neurons increased to some extent. The protein level of CC and its proteolytic activity showed significant increases in particular brain regions of mouse models with pathological conditions the thalamus in cathepsin D-deficient mice, the hippocampus of ipsilateral brain hemispheres after hypoxicischemic brain injury, and peri-damaged portions of brains after penetrating injury. In such pathological conditions, the majority of the cells that were strongly immunopositive for CC were activated microglia. These lines of evidence suggest that CC is involved in normal neuronal function in certain brain regions, and also participates in inflammatory processes accompanying pathogenesis in the CNS."

                        "en": "Ferulic acid (FA), a naturally occurring polyphenol abundant in vegetables and rice bran, is known to possess a potent antioxidant activity, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress. In the present study, we show that in addition to its known anti-oxidant activity, ferulic acid exerts substantial inhibitory activity on cellular mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor)-signaling pathways. In HeLa cells and mouse primary hepatocytes cultured with conventional nutrient-rich media, ferulic acid (1 mM) elicited dephosphorylation of S6 kinase and its substrate ribosomal S6. The dephosphorylating activity of ferulic acid was almost comparable to that of rapamycin, an established mTor inhibitor (TORC1). We next investigated the effect of ferulic acid on autophagy, a major cellular degradative process, which significantly contributes to the maintenance of cell homeostasis. Using a conventional green fluorescent protein-microtubule-associated protein IA/IB light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) dot assay to evaluate autophagy flux, we showed that ferulic acid caused a significant increase in GFP-LC3 dots under serum-rich conditions in HeLa cells. The enhancement of autophagic flux by ferulic acid was almost equivalent to that of rapamycin. Furthermore, ferulic acid significantly enhanced autophagic degradation of C-14-leucine-labeled long-lived proteins of cultured mouse hepatocytes under nutrient-rich conditions, but not nutrient-deprived conditions. These results indicate that ferulic acid is almost the equivalent of rapamycin in the ability to inhibit mTor (TORC1), which makes it a potent activator of basal autophagy."

                        "en": "This review summarizes the historical aspects of the study of peroxisome degradation in mammalian cells. Peroxisomes have diverse metabolic roles in response to environmental changes and are degraded in a preferential manner, by comparison with cytosolic proteins. This review introduces three hypotheses on the degradation mechanisms: (a) the action of the peroxisome-specific Lon protease; (b) the membrane disruption effect of 15-lipoxygenase; and (c) autophagy that sequesters and degrades the organelles by lysosomal enzymes. Among these hypotheses, autophagy is now recognized as the most important mechanism for excess peroxisome degradation. One of the most striking characteristics of peroxisomes is that they are markedly proliferated in the liver by the administration of hypolipidemic drugs and industrial plasticizers. The effects of these substances were fully reversed after withdrawal of the substances, and most of the excess peroxisomes were selectively degraded and recovered to a normal number and size. Autophagic degradation of peroxisomes has been examined using this characteristic phenomenon. Excessive peroxisome degradation that occurs after cessation of hypolipidemic drugs has been extensively investigated biochemically and morphologically. The evidence shows that the degradation of excess peroxisomes and peroxisomal enzymes is inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a specific inhibitor of autophagy. Furthermore, in liver-specific autophagy- deficient mice, rapid removal of peroxisomes was exclusively impaired, and degradation of peroxisomal enzymes was not detected. Thus, the significant contribution of autophagic machinery to peroxisomal degradation in mammals was confirmed. However, the important question of the mechanism for the selective recognition of peroxisomes by autophagosomes remains to be fully elucidated. (C) 2011 IUBMB IUBMB Life, 63(11): 1001-1008, 2011"

                        "en": "Both anabolism and catabolism of the amino acids released by starvation-induced autophagy are essential for cell survival, but their actual metabolic contributions in adult animals are poorly understood. Herein, we report that, in mice, liver autophagy makes a significant contribution to the maintenance of blood glucose by converting amino acids to glucose via gluconeogenesis. Under a synchronous fasting-initiation regimen, autophagy was induced concomitantly with a fall in plasma insulin in the presence of stable glucagon levels, resulting in a robust amino acid release. In liver-specific autophagy (Atg7)-deficient mice, no amino acid release occurred and blood glucose levels continued to decrease in contrast to those of wild-type mice. Administration of serine (30 mg/animal) exerted a comparable effect, raising the blood glucose levels in both control wild-type and mutant mice under starvation. Thus, the absence of the amino acids that were released by autophagic proteolysis is a major reason for a decrease in blood glucose. Autophagic amino acid release in control wild-type livers was significantly suppressed by the prior administration of glucose, which elicited a prompt increase in plasma insulin levels. This indicates that insulin plays a dominant role over glucagon in controlling liver autophagy. These results are the first to show that liver-specific autophagy plays a role in blood glucose regulation."

                        "en": "The abundance of peroxisomes within a cell is rapidly controlled depending on environmental changes and physiological conditions. It is well established that phthalate esters can cause a marked proliferation of peroxisomes (Yokota, 1986). Following induction of peroxisomes by a 2-week treatment with phthalate esters in mouse livers, peroxisomal degradation via autophagy can be induced for the subsequent week after discontinuation of the phthalate esters. Autophagic degradation of peroxisomes can be monitored by electron microscopy as well as biochemical assay for some peroxisome markers. Although most of the excess peroxisomes in the liver are selectively degraded within one week, this rapid removal is exclusively impaired in the autophagy-deficient liver."

                        "en": "We investigated the gene expression profiles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors in HL-60 leukemia cells. In the VEGF family, both mRNA and protein expression of VEGF-C were up-regulated in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-differentiated HL-60 cells. We detected two bands of similar to 31 and similar to 60 kDa in cell lysates, and the higher expression of similar to 31 kDa band was further increased after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A similar to 31 kDa VEGF-C protein was also detected in conditioned media from PNIA-differentiated HL-60 cells after LPS stimulation. The mRNA expression of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and neuropilin-1 (NRP- 1) was markedly up-regulated in PNIA-differentiated HL-60 cells, corresponding to the results from VEGF binding studies, in which VEGF binding activity was increased in PNIA-differentiated HL-60 cells. These did not occur in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-differentiated HL-60 cells. The expression of VEGF-C and VEGF receptors is regulated specifically in HL-60 cells during macrophage differentiation..
