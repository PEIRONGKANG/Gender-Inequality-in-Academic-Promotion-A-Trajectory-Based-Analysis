I have also developed numerical codes based on a self-consistent field (SCF) algorithm that is completely different from conventional algorithms for N-body codes.  These SCF codes are applied to the study of stellar dynamical systems.  [Educational Activities] I have written up some textbooks of my main classes.  In particular, practice problems are prepared concerning the basic fields of elementary mathematics and mechanics.  These textbooks are renewed every year.  For the classes of the first-grade students, the contents are connected to those learned at their high schools, so that they can study advanced contents easily.  For grad students, I have carried out lectures that are of active-learning style."

This approach is realized with a self-consistent field (SCF) method in which the full spatial dependence of the density and potential of a system is expanded in a set of basis functions for solving Poisson's equation. To apply this SCF method to a merging situation where two systems are moving in space, we assign the expansion center to the center of mass of each system, the position of which is followed by a massless particle placed at that positin initially. Merging simulations over a wide range of impact parameters are performed using both an SCF code developed here and a tree code. The results of each simulation produced by the two codes show excellent agreement in the evolving morphology of the merging systems and in the density and velocity dispersion profiles of the merged systems. However, comparing the results generated by the tree code with those obtained with the softening-free SCF code, we found that in large impact parameter cases, a softening length of the Plummer type introduced in the tree code has an effect of advancing the orbital phase of the two systems in the merging process at late times. We demonstrate that the faster orbital phase originates from the larger convergence length to the pure Newtonian force. Other application problems suitable to the current SCF code are also discussed.",

                        "en": "We present hydrodynamic simulations of gas clouds inflowing from the disk to a few hundred parsec region of the Milky Way. A gravitational potential is generated to include realistic Galactic structures by using thousands of multipole expansions (MEs) that describe 6.4 million stellar particles of a self-consistent Galaxy simulation. We find that a hybrid ME model, with two different basis sets and a thick-disk correction, accurately reproduces the overall structures of the Milky Way. Through non-axisymmetric Galactic structures of an elongated bar and spiral arms, gas clouds in the disk inflow to the nuclear region and form a central molecular zone-like nuclear ring. We find that the size of the nuclear ring evolves into similar to 240 pc at T similar to 1500 Myr, regardless of the initial size. For most simulation runs, the rate of gas inflow to the nuclear region is equilibrated to similar to 0.02 M-circle dot yr(-1). The nuclear ring is off-centered, relative to the Galactic center, by the lopsided central mass distribution of the Galaxy model, and thus an asymmetric mass distribution of the nuclear ring arises accordingly. The vertical asymmetry of the Galaxy model also causes the nuclear ring to be tilted along the Galactic plane. During the first similar to 100 Myr, the vertical frequency of the gas motion is twice that of the orbital frequency, thus the projected nuclear ring shows a twisted, infinity-like shape."

                        "en": "The formation and evolution of tidal tails like those observed around some globular clusters and dwarf satellite galaxies is examined with an N-body simulation. In particular, we analyse in detail the evolving tidal features of a one-component satellite that is moving on a highly eccentric orbit in the external field of a host galaxy potential like our own. The results show that every time the satellite approaches apogalacticon, a fresh pair of tidal tails becomes notably prominent, and that eventually, the satellite possesses multiple tidal tails via repeating apocentre passages. Accordingly, the number of observed tidal arms can be used as a tracer of the number of orbital periods that such a system has completed around the centre of its host galaxy. By identifying the arm particles included in each of the first three consecutively formed pairs of tidal tails, we find that each pair of tidal tails is practically identical to one another regarding the energy and angular momentum distributions. In addition, we demonstrate that the density profiles of these three pairs of tidal tails at their first apogalacticons after formation agree well with one another. It therefore follows that themultiplicity in tidal features originates from the repeated episode of tidal arm formation in the course of the precessing motion of a satellite."

                        "en": "The influence of central black holes on the dynamical evolution of bars in disk galaxies was examined. Once a bar formed by a dynamical instability in an infinitesimally thin stellar disk was fully developed, a black hole (BH) was adiabatically added at the center of the disk. Our results indicate that a bar can be completely destroyed, in a practical sense, in a time much smaller than the Hubble time if the central BH mass exceeds about 0.5% of the disk mass. Since this implied minimum BH mass for bar destruction is on the order of 10(8.5) Me for a typical disk galaxy, this process could occur in the real Universe. The bar amplitude decreases gradually with time after the BH has grown up to its full mass. Surface-of-section plots indicate that the bar dissolution originates from the chaotic behavior of bar-supporting orbits. In addition, the scale length and the radial velocity dispersion of the disk after bar dissolution become much larger than those of the initial axisymmetric disk. This finding suggests that it is. possible to discriminate between genuine non-barred galaxies and bar-dissolved galaxies induced by massive central BHs from the viewpoint of structural properties."

                        "en": "A recent observation with the Hipparcos satellite and some numerical simulations imply that the interaction between an oblate halo and a disc is inappropriate for the persistence of galactic warps. Following on from this, we have compared the time evolution of galactic warps in a prolate halo with that in an oblate halo. The haloes were approximated as fixed potentials, while the discs were represented by N-body particles. We have found that the warping in the oblate halo continues to wind up, and finally disappears. On the other hand, for the prolate halo model, the precession rate of the outer disc increases when the precession of the outer disc recedes from that of the inner disc, and vice versa. Consequently, the warping in the prolate halo persisted to the end of the simulation by retaining the alignment of the line of nodes of the warped disc. Therefore, our results suggest that prolate haloes could sustain galactic warps. The physical mechanism of the persistence of warp is discussed on the basis of the torque between a halo and a disc and that between the inner and outer regions of the disc."

                        "en": "It is shown that the cuspy density distributions observed in the cores of elliptical galaxies can be realized by dissipationless gravitational collapse. The initial models consist of power-law density spheres such as rho proportional to r(-1) with anisotropic velocity dispersions. Collapse simulations are carried out by integrating the collisionless Boltzmann equation directly, on the assumption of spherical symmetry. From the results obtained, the extent of constant density cores, formed through violent relaxation, decreases as the velocity anisotropy increases radially, and practically disappears for extremely radially anisotropic models. As a result, the relaxed density distributions become more cuspy with increasing radial velocity anisotropy. It is thus concluded that the velocity anisotropy could be a key ingredient for the formation of density cusps in a dissipationless collapse picture. The velocity dispersions increase with radius in the cores according to the nearly power-law density distributions. The power-law index, n, of the density profiles, defined as rho proportional to r(-n), changes from n approximate to 2.1 at intermediate radii to a shallower power than n approximate to 2.1 toward the centre. This density bend can be explained from our postulated local phase-space constraint that the phase-space density accessible to the relaxed state is determined at each radius by the maximum phase-space density of the initial state."

                        "en": "A particle method for reproducing the phase space of collisionless stellar systems is described. The key idea originates in Liouville's theorem, which states that the distribution function (DF) at time t can be derived from tracing necessary orbits back to t = 0. To make this procedure feasible, a self-consistent held (SCF) method for solving Poisson's equation is adopted to compute the orbits of arbitrary stars. As an example, for the violent relaxation of a uniform density sphere, the phase-space evolution generated by the current method is compared to that obtained with a phase-space method for integrating the collisionless Boltzmann equation, on the assumption of spherical symmetry. Excellent agreement is found between the two methods if an optimal basis set for the SCF technique is chosen. Since this reproduction method requires only the functional form of initial DFs and does not require any assumptions to be made about the symmetry of the system, success in reproducing the phase-space evolution implies that there would be no need of directly solving the collisionless Boltzmann equation in order to access phase space even for systems without any special symmetries. The effects of basis sets used in SCF simulations on the reproduced phase space are also discussed."

                        "en": "First, we have ensured that spherical nonrotating collisionless systems collapse while almost retaining their spherical configurations during the initial contraction phases, even if they are allowed to collapse three-dimensionally Next, based on the assumption of spherical symmetry, we examine the evolution of the velocity dispersions with collapse for those systems having uniform or power-law density profiles with Maxwellian velocity distributions by directly integrating the collisionless Boltzmann equation. The results show that as far as the initial contraction phases are concerned, the radial velocity dispersion never grows faster than the tangential velocity dispersion, except at small radii, where the nearly isothermal nature remains; irrespective of the density profiles and virial ratios. This implies that the velocity anisotropy as an initial condition should be a poor indicator of the radial orbit instability. The growing behavior of the velocity dispersions is briefly discussed from the viewpoint that phase-space density is conserved in collisionless systems."

However, there is a discrepancy known as the“cusp-core problem”in the mass-density distribution of a dark matter halo (DMH) between theory and observation. We investigate the dynamical response of DMHs to recurrent starbursts on the formation of less massive galaxies to solve this issue. In the early epoch of the galaxy formation, the cycle of expansion and contraction of the interstellar gas driven by the stellar feedbacks leads to a recursive change in the gravitational potential of the gas. The eccentricity of the DMH particles around the center becomes large by this change. Then, the system expands, and the core scale increases due to the oscillation process. Finally, the DMH then reaches the new quasi-equilibrium state. Our simulation shows that the energy transport by the overtone components contained in the periodic oscillation of the potential change strongly influences the inner slope of the mass-density profile of the DMH. We conclude that the resonance between DMH particles and the density wave excited by the oscillating potential plays a crucial role in understanding the physical mechanism of the cusp-to-core transition of DMHs.",
