                        "en": "Background and Objectives: The presence of lymph node (LN) metastases is an important prognostic factor in patients with biliary cancers. The aim of this study was to characterize systematically the morphological features of metastatic LNs in biliary cancers.\nMethods: Four hundred ninety-six LNs (including 112 para-aortic LNs) dissected from 47 patients with biliary cancer were examined. The diameter of the long axis (size) and the percent metastatic area relative to whole-node area were measured from histologic specimens.\nResults: The average size of metastatic LNs (9.5 mm) was significantly larger than those without metastasis (6.5 mm; P &lt; 0.01). The optimum cut-off size for positive LNs was &gt;7.5 mm, but the sensitivity of this predictor of metastasis was low (60.8%). In general, metastatic area correlated significantly with the size of metastatic LNs (P = 0.023). Para-aortic LNs contained metastasis in 7.1 % of cases, and only 25% of para-aortic LNs with a high ratio of metastatic area could be evaluated from preoperative CT scans.\nConclusions: Although large LNs are highly suggestive of metastasis, poor detection of many small LNs with a low percentage of metastatic area can increase risk in patients with biliary tract cancer."

                        "en": "Background and Objectives: The presence of lymph node (LN) metastases is an important prognostic factor in patients with biliary cancers. The aim of this study was to characterize systematically the morphological features of metastatic LNs in biliary cancers.\nMethods: Four hundred ninety-six LNs (including 112 para-aortic LNs) dissected from 47 patients with biliary cancer were examined. The diameter of the long axis (size) and the percent metastatic area relative to whole-node area were measured from histologic specimens.\nResults: The average size of metastatic LNs (9.5 mm) was significantly larger than those without metastasis (6.5 mm; P &lt; 0.01). The optimum cut-off size for positive LNs was &gt;7.5 mm, but the sensitivity of this predictor of metastasis was low (60.8%). In general, metastatic area correlated significantly with the size of metastatic LNs (P = 0.023). Para-aortic LNs contained metastasis in 7.1 % of cases, and only 25% of para-aortic LNs with a high ratio of metastatic area could be evaluated from preoperative CT scans.\nConclusions: Although large LNs are highly suggestive of metastasis, poor detection of many small LNs with a low percentage of metastatic area can increase risk in patients with biliary tract cancer."

                        "en": "Background. The prognosis of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer remains very poor. This study was designed to evaluate palliative pancreatic resection with postoperative gemcitabine chemotherapy. Methods. A total of 127 patients underwent palliative pancreatectomy or palliative nonresectable treatment with gemcitabine at Kobe University Hospital and were analyzed. Results. The median survival of patients receiving palliative pancreatectomy with gemcitabine was 15 months, and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 60% and 13%, respectively, while that of patients receiving gemcitabine alone was only 8 months, and their 1- and 3-year survival rates were 26% and 0%. Multivariate analysis showed that gemcitabine was the strongest factor in survival, and no distant metastasis and pancreatectomy were also significant factors. In addition, the median survival of patients undergoing microscopically incomplete resection with gemcitabine was 22 months, and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 60% and 40%. Pancreatectomy with gemcitabine improved the performance status 3 months after surgery, with longer survival compared with the gemcitabine alone group. Conclusions. Microscopically incomplete pancreatectomy with postoperative gemcitabine chemotherapy has a possible role in advanced pancreatic cancer."

                        "en": "Background. The prognosis of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer remains very poor. This study was designed to evaluate palliative pancreatic resection with postoperative gemcitabine chemotherapy. Methods. A total of 127 patients underwent palliative pancreatectomy or palliative nonresectable treatment with gemcitabine at Kobe University Hospital and were analyzed. Results. The median survival of patients receiving palliative pancreatectomy with gemcitabine was 15 months, and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 60% and 13%, respectively, while that of patients receiving gemcitabine alone was only 8 months, and their 1- and 3-year survival rates were 26% and 0%. Multivariate analysis showed that gemcitabine was the strongest factor in survival, and no distant metastasis and pancreatectomy were also significant factors. In addition, the median survival of patients undergoing microscopically incomplete resection with gemcitabine was 22 months, and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 60% and 40%. Pancreatectomy with gemcitabine improved the performance status 3 months after surgery, with longer survival compared with the gemcitabine alone group. Conclusions. Microscopically incomplete pancreatectomy with postoperative gemcitabine chemotherapy has a possible role in advanced pancreatic cancer."

                        "en": "Background In severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), it is clinically important at the time of admission to predict the likelihood of early death. This investigation aimed to clarify the factors predicting early death in SAP. Methods. Early death was defined as death within 10 days after disease onset. Prediction factors for early death were evaluated from data obtained on admission from 93 patients with SAP, and the characteristics of patients who died early were analyzed. Results. Between the early-death and early-survival groups, significant factors were base excess (BE), serum creatinine (Cr), blood sugar, serum glutamate oxaloacetic transaminase, and serum calcium. Multivariate analysis revealed that BE was an independent prediction factor for early death. The early-death rate in patients with BE &lt; -5.5 mEq/1 and Cr &gt;= 3.0 mg/dl was 31 % and 36 %, respectively. The combination of BE and Cr raised the positive predictive value to 50%, and was equally able to predict early death as the Japanese Severity Score (JSS), which was the most useful of the three conventional scoring systems used. All early-death patients had pancreatic necrosis, and their JSS was &gt;= 15 (stage 4). Characteristically, early-death patients had lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; 1300IU/1, or they had serious preexisting comorbidities. Conclusions. As a single parameter, BE was most useful for predicting early death. The combination of BE and Cr could predict early death as well as the JSS. An extreme rise of LDH and serious preexisting comorbidity may also be risk factors for early death."

                        "en": "Purpose. Multiple organ dysfunction and infection are major contributors to the high mortality associated with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) recognizes the lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacilli and is involved in inflammatory response and host defense. We examined the effects of TLR4-deficiency in SAP in mice.\nMethods. Closed duodenal loop-induced pancreatitis was induced in C3H/HeN (wild-type) and C3H/HeJ (TLR4-deficient) mice. We compared the severity of pancreatitis, liver and kidney dysfunction, and bacterial translocation to the pancreas between the two types of mice 12 h after the induction of SAP.\nResults. The severity of pancreatitis was similar in the two types of mice. The TLR4-deficient mice had significantly lower serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine; significantly lower serum levels of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor; reduced apoptosis of the liver and kidney; and a significantly higher rate of positive gram-negative bacterial cultures of the pancreas. TLR4 protein expression in the liver, kidney, and small intestine was increased 4 h after the induction of SAP, and decreased 12 h after the induction of SAP.\nConclusions. TLR4 is implicated in the mechanism of organ dysfunction and bacterial translocation in SAP, and TLR4 may trigger the inflammatory response and function defensively against infection."

                        "en": "Purpose. The purpose of this cohort was to evaluate the long-term patency of the anastomosis and the remnant pancreatic functions.\nMethods. Fifty-six consecutive patients undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy with pancreatic duct invagination anastomosis were enrolled in this study. During the follow-up, changes in the remnant pancreatic duct size, pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions, and nutritional status were monitored.\nResults. No seriously activated pancreatic fistula, no hemorrhagic complications, no reoperations, and no in-hospital deaths were observed after surgery. A dilatation of remnant pancreatic duct was detected a total of 37 times (51%) during annual computed tomography (CT) evaluations. Pancreatic dysfunctions were observed in a considerable number of patients (exocrine 4/12, 9/14, and 8/16, endocrine 9/35, 8/27, and 4/16 at 1, 2, and 3 postoperative years, respectively). Functional declines in the remnant pancreas, duct dilatation, and a decrease in the body mass index were observed from the first year. However, these data did not progressively deteriorate thereafter, at least during the first 3 postoperative years. This study demonstrated a significant correlation between the duct dilatation and endocrine dysfunction.\nConclusion. Our pancreatic duct invagination anastomosis resulted in somewhat limited long-term outcomes, although it did prevent serious complications in the short-term."

                        "en": "Purpose. Multiple organ dysfunction and infection are major contributors to the high mortality associated with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) recognizes the lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacilli and is involved in inflammatory response and host defense. We examined the effects of TLR4-deficiency in SAP in mice.\nMethods. Closed duodenal loop-induced pancreatitis was induced in C3H/HeN (wild-type) and C3H/HeJ (TLR4-deficient) mice. We compared the severity of pancreatitis, liver and kidney dysfunction, and bacterial translocation to the pancreas between the two types of mice 12 h after the induction of SAP.\nResults. The severity of pancreatitis was similar in the two types of mice. The TLR4-deficient mice had significantly lower serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine; significantly lower serum levels of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor; reduced apoptosis of the liver and kidney; and a significantly higher rate of positive gram-negative bacterial cultures of the pancreas. TLR4 protein expression in the liver, kidney, and small intestine was increased 4 h after the induction of SAP, and decreased 12 h after the induction of SAP.\nConclusions. TLR4 is implicated in the mechanism of organ dysfunction and bacterial translocation in SAP, and TLR4 may trigger the inflammatory response and function defensively against infection."

                        "en": "Purpose. The purpose of this cohort was to evaluate the long-term patency of the anastomosis and the remnant pancreatic functions.\nMethods. Fifty-six consecutive patients undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy with pancreatic duct invagination anastomosis were enrolled in this study. During the follow-up, changes in the remnant pancreatic duct size, pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions, and nutritional status were monitored.\nResults. No seriously activated pancreatic fistula, no hemorrhagic complications, no reoperations, and no in-hospital deaths were observed after surgery. A dilatation of remnant pancreatic duct was detected a total of 37 times (51%) during annual computed tomography (CT) evaluations. Pancreatic dysfunctions were observed in a considerable number of patients (exocrine 4/12, 9/14, and 8/16, endocrine 9/35, 8/27, and 4/16 at 1, 2, and 3 postoperative years, respectively). Functional declines in the remnant pancreas, duct dilatation, and a decrease in the body mass index were observed from the first year. However, these data did not progressively deteriorate thereafter, at least during the first 3 postoperative years. This study demonstrated a significant correlation between the duct dilatation and endocrine dysfunction.\nConclusion. Our pancreatic duct invagination anastomosis resulted in somewhat limited long-term outcomes, although it did prevent serious complications in the short-term."

                        "en": "Background. In severe acute pancreatitis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and infectious complications are contributors to high mortality. Interleukin (IL)-15 is a novel cytokine that shares many biologic properties with IL-2. Serum IL-15 levels have not yet been determined in SAP.\nMethods. Serum IL-15 concentrations were measured in 54 patients with severe acute pancreatitis on admission. The relationships with severity, organ dysfunction, infection, and prognosis were analyzed. Utility of IL-15 for the prediction of clinical outcome was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.\nResults. Serum IL-15 levels were increased significantly in severe acute pancreatitis (5.8 +/- 0.5 pg/mL), and they were correlated with Ranson, APACHE II, and japanese severity score. Serum IL-15 levels were greater in patients with organ dysfunction, patients with infection, and nonsurvivors (P &lt; 05 each). Incidences of organ dysfunction in patients whose IL-15 levels were less than 3.0, 3.0-5.3, and greater than or equal to 5.3 pg/mL,. were 8 %, 31 %, and 89 %, respectively (P &lt; .001). Usefulness of IL-15 for the prediction of organ dysfunction was superior to CRP, IL-6, and IL-8, and it was similar to Ranson, APACHE IT, and japanese severity score. Incidences of infection in patients whose IL-15 levels were less than 5.5, 5.5-9.0, and greater than,or equal to 9.0 pg/mL, were 7%, 25%, and 50%, respectively (P &lt; .05). Mortality rates in patients whose IL-15 Levels were less than 5.5, 5.5-9.0, and greater than,or equal to 9.0 pg/mL, were 11 %, 25%, and 80%, respectively (P &lt;. 001). Usefulness of IL-15 for the prediction of death was superior to CRP, IL-6, and IL-8.\nConclusions. Serum IL-15 level is a useful predictor of the complications (especially organ dysfunction) and mortality in severe acute pancreatitis."

                        "en": "Background/Purpose: Sepsis due to infected pancreatic necrosis is the most serious complication in the late phase of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Bacterial translocation from the gut is thought to be the main cause of pancreatic infection. The possibility has recently been reported that selective digestive decontamination (SDD) and enteral nutrition (EN) may alleviate the complications and reduce the mortality rate in patients with SAP. We analyzed the treatment outcome of SDD and EN in patients with SAP.\nMethods: We divided 90 patients with SAP into three groups: SDD(-)EN(-),group A; SDD(+)EN(-), group B; and SDD(+)EN(+), group C. Clinical outcome was analyzed retrospectively. The effect of SDD was compared in groups A and B, and the effect of EN was compared in groups B and C.\nResults: The background of patients was not significantly different between the groups. SDD reduced the incidence of organ dysfunction (from 70% to 59%) and the mortality rate (from 40% to 28%), but the differences were not significant. EN reduced the incidence of infected pancreatic necrosis (from 31% to 24%) and the frequency of surgery for pancreas (from 28% to 18%), and further reduced the mortality rate (from 28% for SDD to 16%), but the differences were not significant. The peripheral lymphocyte count was significantly increased in patients with EN.\nConclusions: SDD and EN did not significantly affect the treatment outcome in SAP. However, the results in this study raise the possibility that SDD and EN may decrease the complications and reduce the mortality rate in SAP. The efficacy of SDD and EN for SAP should be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial."

Four hundred and forty gastric cancer patients were enrolled in this study. The family history (first- and second-degree relatives) was investigated. The 440 patients were divided into three groups: (1) patients with a family history of gastric cancer; (2) patients with a family history of other cancers; and (3) patients without a family history of cancer. Two hundred and four patients (46.4%) reported a family history of cancer. Gastric cancer was the most frequent, with 98 patients having a total of 123 reports of gastric cancer in the family; colorectal cancer was the second most frequent and lung cancer was the third most frequent. The average ages of the group with a family history of gastric cancer and the group with a family history of other cancers were significantly lower than that of the patients without a family history of cancer. Other clinicopathological factors examined showed no significant difference between the groups. Japanese gastric cancer showed aggregation within second-degree relatives. The average age of the patients in the group with a family history of gastric cancer was the only significant factor that differed between gastric cancer patients with and without a family history of cancer."

Size of the main pancreatic duct &gt;= 6.5 mm and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 &gt;= 35 U/mL scored 3 points, main duct type scored 2 points, and patulous papilla, jaundice, diabetes mellitus, and tumor size &gt;= 42 nun scored I point. When IPMNs with 3 and more than 3 points using the new score were diagnosed as malignant, accuracy was 90.6%.\nConclusion: This scoring system for IPMN is feasible to detect malignancy and useful for selecting an appropriate treatment.

                        "en": "Background. In severe acute pancreatitis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and infectious complications are contributors to high mortality. Interleukin (IL)-15 is a novel cytokine that shares many biologic properties with IL-2. Serum IL-15 levels have not yet been determined in SAP.\nMethods. Serum IL-15 concentrations were measured in 54 patients with severe acute pancreatitis on admission. The relationships with severity, organ dysfunction, infection, and prognosis were analyzed. Utility of IL-15 for the prediction of clinical outcome was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.\nResults. Serum IL-15 levels were increased significantly in severe acute pancreatitis (5.8 +/- 0.5 pg/mL), and they were correlated with Ranson, APACHE II, and japanese severity score. Serum IL-15 levels were greater in patients with organ dysfunction, patients with infection, and nonsurvivors (P &lt; 05 each). Incidences of organ dysfunction in patients whose IL-15 levels were less than 3.0, 3.0-5.3, and greater than or equal to 5.3 pg/mL,. were 8 %, 31 %, and 89 %, respectively (P &lt; .001). Usefulness of IL-15 for the prediction of organ dysfunction was superior to CRP, IL-6, and IL-8, and it was similar to Ranson, APACHE IT, and japanese severity score. Incidences of infection in patients whose IL-15 levels were less than 5.5, 5.5-9.0, and greater than,or equal to 9.0 pg/mL, were 7%, 25%, and 50%, respectively (P &lt; .05). Mortality rates in patients whose IL-15 Levels were less than 5.5, 5.5-9.0, and greater than,or equal to 9.0 pg/mL, were 11 %, 25%, and 80%, respectively (P &lt;. 001). Usefulness of IL-15 for the prediction of death was superior to CRP, IL-6, and IL-8.\nConclusions. Serum IL-15 level is a useful predictor of the complications (especially organ dysfunction) and mortality in severe acute pancreatitis."

                        "en": "Background/Purpose: Sepsis due to infected pancreatic necrosis is the most serious complication in the late phase of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Bacterial translocation from the gut is thought to be the main cause of pancreatic infection. The possibility has recently been reported that selective digestive decontamination (SDD) and enteral nutrition (EN) may alleviate the complications and reduce the mortality rate in patients with SAP. We analyzed the treatment outcome of SDD and EN in patients with SAP.\nMethods: We divided 90 patients with SAP into three groups: SDD(-)EN(-),group A; SDD(+)EN(-), group B; and SDD(+)EN(+), group C. Clinical outcome was analyzed retrospectively. The effect of SDD was compared in groups A and B, and the effect of EN was compared in groups B and C.\nResults: The background of patients was not significantly different between the groups. SDD reduced the incidence of organ dysfunction (from 70% to 59%) and the mortality rate (from 40% to 28%), but the differences were not significant. EN reduced the incidence of infected pancreatic necrosis (from 31% to 24%) and the frequency of surgery for pancreas (from 28% to 18%), and further reduced the mortality rate (from 28% for SDD to 16%), but the differences were not significant. The peripheral lymphocyte count was significantly increased in patients with EN.\nConclusions: SDD and EN did not significantly affect the treatment outcome in SAP. However, the results in this study raise the possibility that SDD and EN may decrease the complications and reduce the mortality rate in SAP. The efficacy of SDD and EN for SAP should be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial."

Four hundred and forty gastric cancer patients were enrolled in this study. The family history (first- and second-degree relatives) was investigated. The 440 patients were divided into three groups: (1) patients with a family history of gastric cancer; (2) patients with a family history of other cancers; and (3) patients without a family history of cancer. Two hundred and four patients (46.4%) reported a family history of cancer. Gastric cancer was the most frequent, with 98 patients having a total of 123 reports of gastric cancer in the family; colorectal cancer was the second most frequent and lung cancer was the third most frequent. The average ages of the group with a family history of gastric cancer and the group with a family history of other cancers were significantly lower than that of the patients without a family history of cancer. Other clinicopathological factors examined showed no significant difference between the groups. Japanese gastric cancer showed aggregation within second-degree relatives. The average age of the patients in the group with a family history of gastric cancer was the only significant factor that differed between gastric cancer patients with and without a family history of cancer."

Size of the main pancreatic duct &gt;= 6.5 mm and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 &gt;= 35 U/mL scored 3 points, main duct type scored 2 points, and patulous papilla, jaundice, diabetes mellitus, and tumor size &gt;= 42 nun scored I point. When IPMNs with 3 and more than 3 points using the new score were diagnosed as malignant, accuracy was 90.6%.\nConclusion: This scoring system for IPMN is feasible to detect malignancy and useful for selecting an appropriate treatment.
