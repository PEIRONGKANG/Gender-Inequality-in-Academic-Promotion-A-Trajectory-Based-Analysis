                        "en": "Mincle (also called as Clec4e and Clecsf9) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed in activated phagocytes. Recently, we have demonstrated that Mincle is an FcR gamma-associated activating receptor that senses damaged cells. To search an exogenous ligand(s), we screened pathogenic fungi using cell line expressing Mincle, FcR gamma, and NFAT-GFP reporter. We found that Mincle specifically recognizes the Malassezia species among 50 different fungal species tested. Malassezia is a pathogenic fungus that causes skin diseases, such as tinea versicolor and atopic dermatitis, and fatal sepsis. However, the specific receptor on host cells has not been identified. Mutation of the putative mannose-binding motif within C-type lectin domain of Mincle abrogated Malassezia recognition. Analyses of glycoconjugate microarray revealed that Mincle selectively binds to alpha-mannose but not mannan. Thus, Mincle may recognize specific geometry of alpha-mannosyl residues on Malassezia species and use this to distinguish them from other fungi. Malassezia activated macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines/ chemokines. To elucidate the physiological function of Mincle, Mincle-deficient mice were established. Malassezia-induced cytokine/chemokine production by macrophages from Mincle(-/-) mice was significantly impaired. In vivo inflammatory responses against Malassezia was also impaired in Mincle(-/-) mice. These results indicate that Mincle is the first specific receptor for Malassezia species to be reported and plays a crucial role in immune responses to this fungus."

                        "en": "In the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata, gene targeting to generate knockouts and \"knockins\" is a potentially powerful method for the analysis of gene function. Its importance increased after the C glabrata genome sequence project, but progress in the field is hampered by inefficient mechanisms for gene targeting. With the use of 40-bp homologous flanking DNA, no gene targeting was identified. To address this issue, YKU80 was disrupted, leading to an increase in targeting efficiency of 5.1% using 40-bp flanking homologous DNA. To harness the beneficial effects of YKU80 inactivation on gene targeting frequency without incurring any negative effects, such as synthetic sickness or lethality, we developed a new system whereby the expression of YKU80 was restored following a transient knockdown of expression during transformation. Strains used for this new system carried a SAT1 flipper in the YKU80 promoter region, which was used to repress expression during transformation but was spontaneously excised from the locus after the transformation. By using this strain, DNA damage induced by methyl methane sulfonate, 112021 UV irradiation, and hydroxyurea before and during gene targeting was evaluated and the mutation rate of URA3 was determined. No significant effects of the SAT1 flipper on these processes have been identified. After the SAT1 flipper is excised, a 34-bp FLP recombination target sequence is left in the promoter region. However, the levels of mRNA transcription were restored and no difference in the survival ratio in vivo compared to that with the YKU80 wild-type strain was identified."

Of the nine sulfa drugs, of which sulfaphenazole showed the highest antifungal activity, the MIC values for A. fumigatus and C. neoformans var. grubii were, respectively, 64 μg/ml and 4-8 μg/ml, suggesting high susceptibility of C. neoformans to sulfa drugs."

Transvalencin A showed antimicrobial activity against fungi such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Cryptococcus neoformans. The antibiotic is also active against Gram-positive bacteria such as Micrococcus luteus. We observed higher activity for fungi in an acidic medium than in a neutral medium."

                        "en": "The characteristics of in vitro micafungin (FK463) antifungal activity against six species of dimorphic fungi were investigated in accordance with the NCCLS M27-A microdilution methods. MICs of micafungin, amphotericin B, itraconazole, and fluconazole for Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Penicillium marneffei, and Sporothrix schenckii were determined both for the yeast-like form and mycelial form. Coccidioides immitis was tested only in its mycelial form. We have clearly demonstrated that the in vitro activity of micafungin depends considerably on the growth form of dimorphic fungi. Micafungin exhibited potent activity against the mycelial forms of H. capsulatum, B. dermatitidis, and C. immitis (MIC range, 0.0078 to 0.0625 mug/ml), while it was very weakly active against their yeast-like forms (MIC range, 32 to &gt;64 mug/ml). Micafungin was also more active against the mycelial forms than the yeast-like forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Penicillium marneffei, and S. schenckii. The MICs of amphotericin B were 2 to 5 dilutions lower for the mycelial forms than for the yeast-like forms of B. dermatitidis and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. There was no apparent difference in the activity of itraconazole between the two forms. The MICs of fluconazole for the yeast-like forms were generally lower than those for the mycelial forms, and considerably so for B. dermatitidis. These results suggest that the growth form employed in antifungal susceptibility testing of dimorphic fungi can considerably influence the interpretation of results. At present, it cannot be judged whether micafungin has clinical usefulness for dimorphic fungus infections, since for most fungi it remains uncertain which growth form correlates better with therapeutic outcome. However, the results of this study warrant further investigations of micafungin as a therapeutic agent for infections caused by dimorphic fungi."

The isolate had in vitro urease activity on Christensen's urea agar slants, although the common belief is that H. capsulatum var. duboisii is urease negative, and is, considered one of the characteristic markers that distinguishes the three varieties of H. capsulatum. Forty H. capsulatum var. capsulatum, five H. capsulatum var. duboisii, and five H. capsulatum var. farciminosum isolates were evaluated for urease activity on Christensen's urea agar slants and for other qualitative and quantitative urease assays of activity. All 50 isolates of H. capsulatum used in this study were positive for urease activity, suggesting that urease activity may be universal characteristic of H. capsulatum. We also compared the urease activity and pathogenicity of seven H. capsulatum isolates that convert into yeast-form cells. Although isolate IFM 50954 showed moderate virulence in mice and moderate urease activity among tested H. capsulatum isolates, there was no correlation between level of urease activity and pathogenicity. In addition, scanning electron microscopy revealed that some microconidia of isolate IFM 50954 formed \"double-cell\" configurations that were attached to each other by narrow bases."

FK463 exhibited potent activity against Aspergillus species, which was superior to those of all other compounds tested. FK463 was also active against the dematiaceous fungi Cladosporium trichoides, Exophiala spinifera, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, and Exophiala dermatitidis except for certain clinical isolates. However, FK463 had no activity against Fusarium solani, Pseudallesheria boydii, and the zygomycetes Absidia corymbifera, Cunninghamella elegans, Rhizopus oryzae, and Rhizopus microsporus var. rhizopodiformis. These results suggest that FK463 has potential utility for the treatment for infections caused by Aspergillus species and dematiaceous fungi. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel."

                        "en": "Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a deep mycosis caused by the thermo-dependent dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and is prevalent in Latin American countries. Diagnosis of PCM is sometimes difficult outside the endemic countries, thus a rapid and conclusive method for diagnosis of PCM has been anticipated. We compared the sensitivities of a nested PCR method for detecting the gp43 gene and a commercial kit for detecting (l→3)-β-D-glucan in the blood of experimentally infected mice. Blood samples were collected from mice at 0 (soon after inoculation), 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours and 5, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28 and 56 days after the intravenous inoculation of 106 yeast cells of P. brasiliensis and were separated into clots and plasma. The (l→3)-β-D-glucan detection kit in the plasma showed positive reactions in some samples within 7 days and 28 and 56 days after infections. In contrast, the PCR method was more sensitive than the (l→3)-β-D-glucan detection kit throughout the observation period. The clot samples yielded more sensitive PCR-results than did the plasma samples. Although 24 hours is required for the PCR detection, it was confirmed to provide an accurate diagnosis of PCM. © 2002, The Japanese Society for Medical Mycology. All rights reserved."
