In this lesson, each student was first asked to indicate a preference for either hydrophilic or hydrophobic lining for the diaper, and then to prepare two diapers using hydrophilic or hydrophobic lining,water-absorbent padding and backing.A Iarge percentage of studentsexpressed the common assumption that since hydrophilic materials were suitable for fabrics contacting the skin they were also suitable for the lining of diapers. However, after a measured quantity of water was poured onto the two diapers and the two linings were compared by touch, the students recognised their misconception. They also observed that the water absorption rate of commercial diapers was much faster than those of their own making, illustrating the absorption mechanism. Thus they learned that many aspects of science and technology taught in school, such as capillary action and super absorbent polymer to soak up large amounts of water, were employed in the production of disposable diapers which they had formerly regarded simply as paper and cotton pulp. This research should enable us to recognize the need to adopt as learning subjects objects in the daily livers of the learners.",

A sample of 167 female college students first rated photographs of eight styles of daytime wear on 13 pairs of polar adjectives and again after a 7-day interval. Discrepancy scores for each subject (the intra-individual consistency in the evaluation) was obtained by computing the absolute arithmetic difference between the two ratings on the same set of scales. Based on the scores, the subjects were classified into three groups: high, medium, and low intra-individual consistency. Analysis of variance of mean ratings by the three groups revealed that significant differences existed in 34 of 104 combinations of the eight styles of clothing and the 13 semantic differential scales. Mean ratings of the subjects with low intra-individual consistency were closer to 4, the neutral rating on the seven point scale, as compared to those of the subjects with high intra-individual consistency. Mean correlation coefficients for style evaluation subscales, image evaluation subscales, and synthetic evaluation subscales were 0.43, 0.47, and 0.76 respectively. Correlation coefficients for each style of clothing obtained from the mean score of the subjects in each semantic differential scale were around 0.98, indicating that the mean scores of the subjects in each scale could yield excellent stability in clothing evaluation.",

In order to compare the differences and the ambiguity, female college students rated their perceptual awareness to clothing norms on a fuzzy graphic rating scale developed by Hesketh et al. Four photographs of daytime dress style ranging from casual to dressy were used as stimuli and the extent of appropriateness of each dress in four social situations (shopping in a convenience store, attending classes at college, visiting a relative, attending a wedding party) was rated on the fuzzy graphic rating scale with the appropriateness-inappropriateness pair. The main point score (\"most exactly fit point\" in the scale) and range of fuzzy ratings on appropriateness were obtained for each of the four types of dress. The mean range of fuzzy ratings corresponding to intraindividual ambiguity became greater in cases in which the main pointt scores and the extent of appropriateness were intermediate. In addition, the standard deviations of the main point score, corresponding to interindividual differences, were larger than the magnitude of the mean range of the intermediate main point score, whereas they were nearly equal to that of the mean range of the high or low main point score.",

In order to compare the differences and the ambiguity, female college students rated their perceptual awareness to clothing norms on a fuzzy graphic rating scale developed by Hesketh et al.

                        "en": "This study was designed to examine whether or not color synesthesia effect, apparent weight or apparent stability, which was widespread in chromatic objects, was observed in clothing. The first group of 72 female college students were asked to rank stimuli according to judging their apparent weight. One stimulus was 5 circular solid figures of the same size, 4 cm in diameter, but of different color value, the other stimulus was 5 one-piece dress figures of the same size, a height of 7.5 cm, but of the same color as the circles respectively. The second group of 72 students were instructed to rank according to their apparent stability 5 circular solid figures whose upper half and lower half differed in color value or 5 twe-piece dress figures of the same color as the circles respectively. The average and variance of ranks given to each object were represented by the rank graph. The average apparent weight of the 5 circles or the 5 dress increased as their value increased. The average apparent stability of the 5 circles or the 5 dress with different value at upper and lower half were ranked with the average value of the portions. These results suggested that the effect of color value on the apparent weight or the apparent stability in the clothing figures was similar with in the circular figures."

Each fabric was fixed on the open ring, made from poly-propylene sheet, and /as put in the cylinder of this device. The air permeability of multiple layers of fabrics was closely related to the air pressure difference of two sides of layers and the flow rate (v) of air through the layers. Both of them were measured as the change of water level, ΔP (mmH_2O), and of v (200cm^3/sec) respectively. In the case of 16 different kinds of fabrics, a plot of ΔP vs. the number of layers of fabrics (N) gave a straight line in the range of N≦5 layers. The slopes of the lines, for fabrics of low air permeability (such as polyester taffeta, nylon taffeta and so on), were larger than those for permeable fabrics (such as cotton shirting, cotton knitting and so on). This device was applied to the following three cases as a teaching material in elementary school; (1) combination effect of three layers of fabrics (two sheets of cotton knitting and a sheet of polyester taffeta), (2) washing influence of cotton shirting, (3) sizing effect of cotton shirting.",
