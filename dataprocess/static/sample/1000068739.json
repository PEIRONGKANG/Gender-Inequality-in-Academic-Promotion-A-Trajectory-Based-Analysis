                        "en": "Background: It is important to predict the occurrence of deep infection in open fractures when treating such fractures. We tried to develop a new scoring system for predicting the occurrence of deep infection in open tibial fractures on the basis of the Hannover Fracture Scale '98 (HFS-98).\nMaterials: A total of 202 open tibial fractures (195 patients) were retrospectively reviewed in the initial analysis. The relationship between Gustilo's grade and the eight items on the HFS in the open tibial fractures was first investigated by multivariate analysis. By this analysis, we selected significant items that correlated with Gustilo's grade. Among these cases, 179 patients with 185 open tibial fractures were used for the following infection analyses. The relationships between the incidence of deep infection and age (&lt; 46 years, 46-60 years, &lt; 60 years), grade of trauma (ISS &lt; 18,18 &lt;= ISS &lt;= 30, ISS &gt; 30), fracture location, or some significant items in the above initial analysis were further analyzed by multivariate analysis after univariate analysis. We devised a new scoring system of open tibial fractures based on p values in the above analysis. The discrimination of the newly devised scoring system was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curves.\nResults: The following were significant factors affecting the occurrence of deep infection on multivariate analysis: bone loss (p = 0.012); muscle injury (p = 0.012); wound contamination (p = 0.0001); and local circulation (p = 0.0001). We devised a new scoring system for open tibial fractures (bone loss: 0-20 points, muscle injury: 0-20 points, wound contamination: 0-30 points, and local circulation: 0-30 points).

We tried to develop a new scoring system for predicting the occurrence of deep infection in open tibial fractures on the basis of the Hannover Fracture Scale '98 (HFS-98).\nMaterials: A total of 202 open tibial fractures (195 patients) were retrospectively reviewed in the initial analysis. The relationship between Gustilo's grade and the eight items on the HFS in the open tibial fractures was first investigated by multivariate analysis. By this analysis, we selected significant items that correlated with Gustilo's grade. Among these cases, 179 patients with 185 open tibial fractures were used for the following infection analyses. The relationships between the incidence of deep infection and age (&lt; 46 years, 46-60 years, &lt; 60 years), grade of trauma (ISS &lt; 18,18 &lt;= ISS &lt;= 30, ISS &gt; 30), fracture location, or some significant items in the above initial analysis were further analyzed by multivariate analysis after univariate analysis. We devised a new scoring system of open tibial fractures based on p values in the above analysis. The discrimination of the newly devised scoring system was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curves.\nResults: The following were significant factors affecting the occurrence of deep infection on multivariate analysis: bone loss (p = 0.012); muscle injury (p = 0.012); wound contamination (p = 0.0001); and local circulation (p = 0.0001).

                        "en": "Background: The treatment of type IIIB open tibial fractures remains a challenge for orthopedic surgeons, particularly with respect to the soft-tissue and subsequent bony reconstruction. The primary shortening and limb lengthening (PSLL) simplifies wound closure for severe open injuries without requiring microsurgical procedures as a main advantage. This method is thought to be also useful for type IIIB patients with polytrauma and other life-threatening injuries because it helps to control both wound sepsis and their general state. In the present study, we attempted to assess the problems, longterm functional outcome, and quality of life (QOL) of patients who were treated by PSLL for Gustilo type IIIB open tibial fractures in our facility.\nMethods: Six patients with type IIIB open tibia] fractures treated with PSLL were retrospectively reviewed. The mean shortening length was 7.4 cm (range, 4.5-10.3 cm). The mean percent shortening of the entire bone was 18.7% (range, 12.3-29.7%). Limb lengthening started at a mean interval of 10.3 months (range, 3-18 months) after the original injury. The mean healing index was 56.5 days/cm (range, 31.3-86.7 days/cm). The complications, functional outcome, and quality of life were evaluated for all cases.\nResults:. One superficial infection at the initial corticotomy, one deep infection around the shortening site, one refracture at the healed docking site, several wire breaks in external frames in two cases, and two severe equinovarus deformities occurred as complications of these procedures. Regarding functional outcome, three patients showed good outcome, two showed fair outcome, and one showed poor outcome. The percent shortening of the entire bone in the two fair cases were more than 25%. The median scale of physical health summary, mental health summary, and total general health summary in Short Form-36 (QOL) were lower than the standard scale in age-matched individuals.\nConclusions: This PSLL treatment was thought to be a useful option for severe open fracture of the tibia, which had bony defect in more than 4.5 cm in length after serial debridement, although several complications occurred in this regimen. However, it is difficult to achieve an excellent function and QOL using these techniques. In addition, it is difficult for patients who underwent limb lengthening after shortening more than 25% of the total length of bone to gain good function."

                        "en": "Background: The treatment of type IIIB open tibial fractures remains a challenge for orthopedic surgeons, particularly with respect to the soft-tissue and subsequent bony reconstruction. The primary shortening and limb lengthening (PSLL) simplifies wound closure for severe open injuries without requiring microsurgical procedures as a main advantage. This method is thought to be also useful for type IIIB patients with polytrauma and other life-threatening injuries because it helps to control both wound sepsis and their general state. In the present study, we attempted to assess the problems, longterm functional outcome, and quality of life (QOL) of patients who were treated by PSLL for Gustilo type IIIB open tibial fractures in our facility.\nMethods: Six patients with type IIIB open tibia] fractures treated with PSLL were retrospectively reviewed. The mean shortening length was 7.4 cm (range, 4.5-10.3 cm). The mean percent shortening of the entire bone was 18.7% (range, 12.3-29.7%). Limb lengthening started at a mean interval of 10.3 months (range, 3-18 months) after the original injury. The mean healing index was 56.5 days/cm (range, 31.3-86.7 days/cm). The complications, functional outcome, and quality of life were evaluated for all cases.\nResults:. One superficial infection at the initial corticotomy, one deep infection around the shortening site, one refracture at the healed docking site, several wire breaks in external frames in two cases, and two severe equinovarus deformities occurred as complications of these procedures. Regarding functional outcome, three patients showed good outcome, two showed fair outcome, and one showed poor outcome. The percent shortening of the entire bone in the two fair cases were more than 25%. The median scale of physical health summary, mental health summary, and total general health summary in Short Form-36 (QOL) were lower than the standard scale in age-matched individuals.\nConclusions: This PSLL treatment was thought to be a useful option for severe open fracture of the tibia, which had bony defect in more than 4.5 cm in length after serial debridement, although several complications occurred in this regimen. However, it is difficult to achieve an excellent function and QOL using these techniques. In addition, it is difficult for patients who underwent limb lengthening after shortening more than 25% of the total length of bone to gain good function."

                        "en": "We retrospectively studied 15 children with tibial fractures associated with crush injuries to the soft tissues of the dorsal foot. The fractures, including six open fractures, were united with no complications within an average of 11.1 weeks. Wound closure to treat crush injuries of the dorsal foot was achieved using split- or full-thickness skin grafts in most patients. The outcomes of these grafts were acceptable, and all skin coverage was successful and remained viable with no breakdown. Extensor tendon injuries of the foot sustained by eight patients could not be sutured or repaired due to the nature of the injuries. However, the functional abilities of those injured tendons that could be sutured to surrounding tissues in a neutral position were acceptable, even though two patients had contracture of the toes that was problematic when wearing shoes. To manage crush skin injuries of the dorsal foot, split- or full-thickness skin grafts appear to provide a simple and convenient treatment strategy. In cases associated with extensor tendon injuries, suturing damaged extensor tendons to surrounding tissues represents another useful strategy with acceptable outcomes. (C) 200 Elsevier Science Ltd.

                        "en": "We retrospectively studied 15 children with tibial fractures associated with crush injuries to the soft tissues of the dorsal foot. The fractures, including six open fractures, were united with no complications within an average of 11.1 weeks. Wound closure to treat crush injuries of the dorsal foot was achieved using split- or full-thickness skin grafts in most patients. The outcomes of these grafts were acceptable, and all skin coverage was successful and remained viable with no breakdown. Extensor tendon injuries of the foot sustained by eight patients could not be sutured or repaired due to the nature of the injuries. However, the functional abilities of those injured tendons that could be sutured to surrounding tissues in a neutral position were acceptable, even though two patients had contracture of the toes that was problematic when wearing shoes. To manage crush skin injuries of the dorsal foot, split- or full-thickness skin grafts appear to provide a simple and convenient treatment strategy. In cases associated with extensor tendon injuries, suturing damaged extensor tendons to surrounding tissues represents another useful strategy with acceptable outcomes. (C) 200 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Seventy-four femoral fractures (6.9 patients) were initially stabilized with ILNs in static condition. Among these fractures, ten static ILNs were dynamized after approximately 6 (median 6.4, range 1-13) months because of poor fracture healing. Reamed ILNs were performed for 55 fractures and unreamed ILNs for 19 fractures. Clinical and roentgenograhic processes were analyzed with emphasis on whether or not ILNs were dynamized. To evaluate any significant contributing factors affecting the nonunion of femoral shaft fractures treated with ILNs, logistic regression analysis was done. The union rates of static ILNs and dynamized ILNs were 92% (59/64) and 70% (7/10) respectively, but there was no significant difference between them. Five nonunions were seen in reamed ILNs and three in unreamed ILNs. The predictive logistic regression equation for nonunion was as follows: Log 1-p/p = 1.05 -1.20 × AO/ASIF fracture grade in the femur -3.07 × existence of multiskeletal trauma in lower extremity + 0.06 × age -1.11 × smoking history -0.3 × existence of polytrauma -0.626 × the severity of soft tissue injury (p = 0.002\n each variable in the above equation was arranged according to the significant order). Among the variables, AO fracture grade (type C) in the femur and existence of multiskeletal trauma in lower extremity were significantly related to nonunion. Static ILN in most femoral shaft fractures does not inhibit the process of fracture healing. The following associated skeletal lesions were our concerns for nonunion and broken nail in static or dynamic ILNs: (1) C-type femoral fracture\n and (2) existence of multiskeletal trauma, such as double lesions in the ipsilateral femur, floating knee injury, and bilateral femoral fractures."

Five nonunions were seen in reamed ILNs and three in unreamed ILNs. The predictive logistic regression equation for nonunion was as follows: Log 1-p/p = 1.05 -1.20 × AO/ASIF fracture grade in the femur -3.07 × existence of multiskeletal trauma in lower extremity + 0.06 × age -1.11 × smoking history -0.3 × existence of polytrauma -0.626 × the severity of soft tissue injury (p = 0.002\n each variable in the above equation was arranged according to the significant order). Among the variables, AO fracture grade (type C) in the femur and existence of multiskeletal trauma in lower extremity were significantly related to nonunion. Static ILN in most femoral shaft fractures does not inhibit the process of fracture healing. The following associated skeletal lesions were our concerns for nonunion and broken nail in static or dynamic ILNs: (1) C-type femoral fracture\n and (2) existence of multiskeletal trauma, such as double lesions in the ipsilateral femur, floating knee injury, and bilateral femoral fractures."

                        "en": "Multiple-injury patients absorb a large amount of trauma energy in their trunk, resulting in multiple organ injuries and often long-bone and axial skeletal fractures. Severity of these injuries can be quantified using the Trauma Index (TI) and Injury Severity Score (ISS). These systems allow not only a comparison of mortality and morbidity among institutions, but also serve as criteria for triage, emergency, and subsequent management of patients. We reviewed 229 multiple-trauma patients with orthopedic injuries who were treated in our trauma center. Based on the aim of orthopedic intervention performed within 1 week of injury, patients were divided into four groups: group A, surgery for supporting patient's life (n=8)\n group B, surgery for salvaging limbs and limb function (n=81)\n group C, surgery for preventing the development of serious complications (n=92)\n and group D, minor surgery performed according to the general situation (n=48). Both the TI and ISS were compared among these four groups. Furthermore, both the TI and ISS were compared between patients who died within 24 h and those who survived for longer. The ISS was significantly different between groups B and C (P&lt\n0.05), while it was not different among the other groups. Both the TI and ISS were significantly different between the group in which the patients died within 24 h and the group in which the patients survived more than 24 h (P&lt\n0.0001). The most important points in treating the skeletal trauma in multiple-injury patients are to accurately evaluate injury severity and plan the optimal procedure taking into consideration the aim of treatment. © 2002 Springer-Verlag."

                        "en": "Multiple-injury patients absorb a large amount of trauma energy in their trunk, resulting in multiple organ injuries and often long-bone and axial skeletal fractures. Severity of these injuries can be quantified using the Trauma Index (TI) and Injury Severity Score (ISS). These systems allow not only a comparison of mortality and morbidity among institutions, but also serve as criteria for triage, emergency, and subsequent management of patients. We reviewed 229 multiple-trauma patients with orthopedic injuries who were treated in our trauma center. Based on the aim of orthopedic intervention performed within 1 week of injury, patients were divided into four groups: group A, surgery for supporting patient's life (n=8)\n group B, surgery for salvaging limbs and limb function (n=81)\n group C, surgery for preventing the development of serious complications (n=92)\n and group D, minor surgery performed according to the general situation (n=48). Both the TI and ISS were compared among these four groups. Furthermore, both the TI and ISS were compared between patients who died within 24 h and those who survived for longer. The ISS was significantly different between groups B and C (P&lt\n0.05), while it was not different among the other groups. Both the TI and ISS were significantly different between the group in which the patients died within 24 h and the group in which the patients survived more than 24 h (P&lt\n0.0001). The most important points in treating the skeletal trauma in multiple-injury patients are to accurately evaluate injury severity and plan the optimal procedure taking into consideration the aim of treatment. © 2002 Springer-Verlag."
