                        "en": "We studied the expression and localization of JunD, a component of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), in the mouse submanclibular gland with immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. In adult mice, all seven Jun and Fos family members constituting the AP-1 complex were expressed more abundantly in the female gland than in the male gland, and JunD was the most abundant of the members. Immunoreactivity for JunD was localized exclusively in the duct system of the gland, in which it was localized to the nuclei of intercalated duct (ID) cells and a subpopulation of striated duct (SD) cells located adjacent to ID. In contrast, granular convoluted tubule (GCT) cells; which are much more abundant in the male gland, were devoid of JunD. During postnatal development of the male gland, JunD was lost from the duct cells as they differentiated to GCT cells at 3-5 weeks postpartum. When GCT differentiation was induced in adult female gland by testosterone administration, many JunD-negative SID cells were temporarily induced to express JunD after 6-24 hr, but those cells lost JunD as they completely converted to GCT cells by 48 hr. These results suggested that JunD is involved in the differentiation of the duct system of mouse submanclibular gland, in which there is crosstalk between the androgen/androgen receptor system and the AP-1 complex."

                        "en": "We studied the expression and localization of JunD, a component of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), in the mouse submanclibular gland with immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. In adult mice, all seven Jun and Fos family members constituting the AP-1 complex were expressed more abundantly in the female gland than in the male gland, and JunD was the most abundant of the members. Immunoreactivity for JunD was localized exclusively in the duct system of the gland, in which it was localized to the nuclei of intercalated duct (ID) cells and a subpopulation of striated duct (SD) cells located adjacent to ID. In contrast, granular convoluted tubule (GCT) cells; which are much more abundant in the male gland, were devoid of JunD. During postnatal development of the male gland, JunD was lost from the duct cells as they differentiated to GCT cells at 3-5 weeks postpartum. When GCT differentiation was induced in adult female gland by testosterone administration, many JunD-negative SID cells were temporarily induced to express JunD after 6-24 hr, but those cells lost JunD as they completely converted to GCT cells by 48 hr. These results suggested that JunD is involved in the differentiation of the duct system of mouse submanclibular gland, in which there is crosstalk between the androgen/androgen receptor system and the AP-1 complex."

In this study, by use of immunohistochemistry at light and electron microscopic levels in combination with enzyme histochemistry for alkaline phosphatase, we demonstrated that PECAM-1/CD31 is expressed in the mouse primordial germ cell (PGC). Up to 8 days postcoitum (dpc), PGCs with alkaline phosphatase activity showed no PECAM-1/CD31 immunoreactivity. At 9 dpc, PECAM-1/CD31 immunoreactivity was first detected with low intensity in some PGCs located in the hindgut. Between 10 and 11 dpc, intense immunoreactivity was shown on the entire surface of PGCs migrating along the dorsal wall. After arrival and settlement of PGCs in the genital ridges around 11.5 dpc, the intense immunoreactivity was maintained on the entire surface of PGCs. By electron microscopy, the immunoreactivity was localized exclusively on the plasma membrane of PGCs, being as strong at the portions adjacent to neighboring PGCs as those adjacent to somatic cells. As the male and female gonads began to differentiate, PECAM-1/CD31 immunoreactivity remained strong in germ cells until 13 dpc, after which it gradually decreased in intensity and disappeared by 16 dpc. These results suggested that cell-to-cell interaction through PECAM-1/CD31 plays roles in the development of PGCs during their migration on the dorsal wall and homing in the gonads."

                        "en": "The platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), or CD31, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is located on the plasma membrane of endothelial and hematopoietic cells and involved in vascular development and inflammation. In this study, by use of immunohistochemistry at light and electron microscopic levels in combination with enzyme histochemistry for alkaline phosphatase, we demonstrated that PECAM-1/CD31 is expressed in the mouse primordial germ cell (PGC). Up to 8 days postcoitum (dpc), PGCs with alkaline phosphatase activity showed no PECAM-1/CD31 immunoreactivity. At 9 dpc, PECAM-1/CD31 immunoreactivity was first detected with low intensity in some PGCs located in the hindgut. Between 10 and 11 dpc, intense immunoreactivity was shown on the entire surface of PGCs migrating along the dorsal wall. After arrival and settlement of PGCs in the genital ridges around 11.5 dpc, the intense immunoreactivity was maintained on the entire surface of PGCs. By electron microscopy, the immunoreactivity was localized exclusively on the plasma membrane of PGCs, being as strong at the portions adjacent to neighboring PGCs as those adjacent to somatic cells. As the male and female gonads began to differentiate, PECAM-1/CD31 immunoreactivity remained strong in germ cells until 13 dpc, after which it gradually decreased in intensity and disappeared by 16 dpc. These results suggested that cell-to-cell interaction through PECAM-1/CD31 plays roles in the development of PGCs during their migration on the dorsal wall and homing in the gonads."

                        "en": "Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is the key step for the development of atherosclerosis. The 12/15-lipoxygenase expressed in macrophages is capable of oxygenating linoleic acid esterified to cholesterol in the LDL particle, and thus this enzyme is presumed to initiate LDL oxidation. We recently reported that LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) was required for the enzyme-mediated LDL oxidation by macrophages and suggested the selective uptake of cholesterol ester from LDL to the plasma membrane (Xu, W., Takahashi, Y., Sakashita, T., Iwasaki, T., Hattori, H., and Yoshimoto. T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem 276,36454-36459). To elucidate precise mechanisms of lipoxygenase-mediated LDL oxidation, we investigated the intracellular localization of 12/15-lipoxygenase. The 12/15-lipoxygenase was predominantly detected in cytosol of resting peritoneal macrophages and of macrophage-like J774A.1 cells permanently transfected with the cDNA for the enzyme. When the cells were treated with LDL and subjected to subcellular fractionation, the 12/15-lipoxygenase was detected in the membranes with a concomitant decrease in cytosol as shown by Western blot analysis. The levels of the enzyme associated with the membrane reached maximum in 15 min after LDL addition and then decreased. However, the enzymatic activity of 12/15-lipoxygenase in the membrane fraction was very weak even after LDL treatment. This fact supports the suicide inactivation of the enzyme by the oxygenation of cholesterol ester transferred from the LDL particle to the plasma membrane. Immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody against 12/15-lipoxygenase revealed that the plasma membrane was the major site of the enzyme translocation by the LDL treatment. LDL-dependent 12/15-lipoxygenase translocation was inhibited by a blocking antibody against LRP. Furthermore, an enzyme translocation inhibitor, L655238, inhibited the LDL oxidation caused by the 12/15-lipoxygenase. We propose that cholesterol ester selectively transferred from the LDL particle to the plasma membrane via LRP is oxygenated by 12/15-lipoxygenase translocated to this membrane."

                        "en": "Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is the key step for the development of atherosclerosis. The 12/15-lipoxygenase expressed in macrophages is capable of oxygenating linoleic acid esterified to cholesterol in the LDL particle, and thus this enzyme is presumed to initiate LDL oxidation. We recently reported that LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) was required for the enzyme-mediated LDL oxidation by macrophages and suggested the selective uptake of cholesterol ester from LDL to the plasma membrane (Xu, W., Takahashi, Y., Sakashita, T., Iwasaki, T., Hattori, H., and Yoshimoto. T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem 276,36454-36459). To elucidate precise mechanisms of lipoxygenase-mediated LDL oxidation, we investigated the intracellular localization of 12/15-lipoxygenase. The 12/15-lipoxygenase was predominantly detected in cytosol of resting peritoneal macrophages and of macrophage-like J774A.1 cells permanently transfected with the cDNA for the enzyme. When the cells were treated with LDL and subjected to subcellular fractionation, the 12/15-lipoxygenase was detected in the membranes with a concomitant decrease in cytosol as shown by Western blot analysis. The levels of the enzyme associated with the membrane reached maximum in 15 min after LDL addition and then decreased. However, the enzymatic activity of 12/15-lipoxygenase in the membrane fraction was very weak even after LDL treatment. This fact supports the suicide inactivation of the enzyme by the oxygenation of cholesterol ester transferred from the LDL particle to the plasma membrane. Immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody against 12/15-lipoxygenase revealed that the plasma membrane was the major site of the enzyme translocation by the LDL treatment. LDL-dependent 12/15-lipoxygenase translocation was inhibited by a blocking antibody against LRP. Furthermore, an enzyme translocation inhibitor, L655238, inhibited the LDL oxidation caused by the 12/15-lipoxygenase. We propose that cholesterol ester selectively transferred from the LDL particle to the plasma membrane via LRP is oxygenated by 12/15-lipoxygenase translocated to this membrane."

Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the temporal and spatial occurrence of Hsp25 in Meckel's cartilage in embryonic mice mandibles, and in other types of cartilage in both embryonic and adult mice. In adults, Hsp25 immunoreactivity was detected in the hypertrophic chondrocytes located in growth plates of long bones and in non-osteogenic laryngeal and tracheal cartilages. No chondrocytes in the resting or proliferating phase exhibited Hsp25 immunoreactivity. In the embryonic mandibles, resting and proliferating chondrocytes in the anterior and intermediate portions of Meckel's cartilage showed Hsp25 immunoreactivity from the 12th day of gestation (E12) through E15, whereas those in the posterior portion showed little or no immunoreactivity. After E16, the overall Hsp25 immunoreactivity in Meckel's cartilage substantially reduced in intensity, and little or no immunoreactivity was detected in the hypertrophic chondrocytes located in the degenerating portions of Meckel's cartilage. The antisense oligonucleotide for Hsp25 mRNA applied to the culture media of the mandibular explants from 1310 embryos caused significant inhibition of the development of the anterior and middle portions of Meckel's cartilage. These results suggested that Hsp25 is essential for the development of Meckel's cartilage and plays different roles in Meckel's cartilage from those in the permanent cartilages and the cartilages undergoing endochondral ossification."

                        "en": "The 25-kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp25) is expressed in the cartilage of the growth plate and suggested to function in chondrocyte differentiation and degeneration. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the temporal and spatial occurrence of Hsp25 in Meckel's cartilage in embryonic mice mandibles, and in other types of cartilage in both embryonic and adult mice. In adults, Hsp25 immunoreactivity was detected in the hypertrophic chondrocytes located in growth plates of long bones and in non-osteogenic laryngeal and tracheal cartilages. No chondrocytes in the resting or proliferating phase exhibited Hsp25 immunoreactivity. In the embryonic mandibles, resting and proliferating chondrocytes in the anterior and intermediate portions of Meckel's cartilage showed Hsp25 immunoreactivity from the 12th day of gestation (E12) through E15, whereas those in the posterior portion showed little or no immunoreactivity. After E16, the overall Hsp25 immunoreactivity in Meckel's cartilage substantially reduced in intensity, and little or no immunoreactivity was detected in the hypertrophic chondrocytes located in the degenerating portions of Meckel's cartilage. The antisense oligonucleotide for Hsp25 mRNA applied to the culture media of the mandibular explants from 1310 embryos caused significant inhibition of the development of the anterior and middle portions of Meckel's cartilage. These results suggested that Hsp25 is essential for the development of Meckel's cartilage and plays different roles in Meckel's cartilage from those in the permanent cartilages and the cartilages undergoing endochondral ossification."

                        "en": "It has been suggested that the 27 kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp27) plays a role at crucial cellular checkpoints for proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. We examined the immunolocalization of Hsp27 in the rat submandibular gland during postnatal development, wherein acinar cells proliferate and differentiate at earlier postnatal periods. At 2 weeks of age, weak Hsp27 immunoreactivity was distributed diffusely over all gland components. At 3 weeks, Hsp27 immunoreactivity disappeared in most parts of the acini and ducts, but was intensely accumulated in a small cell population located in the acinar center. This population was composed mostly of terminal tubule (TT) type I cells. At 4 weeks, the Hsp27-immunopositive cell population in the acinar center was composed primarily of immature (type ID acinar cells, partly of immature (granulated) intercalated duct (ID) cells, and occasionally of apoptotic cells. After 5 weeks, all acinar components became mature and were no longer immunoreactive for Hsp27. When acinar cell differentiation was accelerated by administration of isoproterenol to 3-week-old rats for 7 days, the number of Hsp27-positive cells was significantly lower than in the control gland at 4 weeks, confirming that Hsp27 expression is downregulated in mature acinar cells. These results suggest that at around 3-4 weeks in postnatal development, the centroacinar TT cells stop proliferating and begin to differentiate into acinar and ID cells, and occasionally undergo apoptosis. Hsp27 is transiently expressed in the centroacinar TT cells during this critical period, and thus may play a role in their differentiation into the immediate descendants. Anat Rec 264:358-366, 2001.

In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry further localized Hsp27 mRNA and protein to both neurons and satellite cells in all types of ganglia examined. Schwann cells in the ganglia and peripheral nerve fibers were devoid of Hsp27 signal. These results suggested that Hsp27 is constitutively expressed in neurons and satellite cells in the entire peripheral nervous system of the rat. Anat Rec 262: 213-220, 2001.

                        "en": "The aim of this study was to examine whether a specific PPAR gamma ligand can inhibit the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells through induction of terminal differentiation. PPAR gamma was expressed in five human pancreatic cancer cell lines: Capan-1, AsPC-1, BxPC-3, PANC-1, and MIA PaCa-2. Treatment of these cells with a specific PPAR gamma ligand, thiazolidinedione (TZD), resulted in inhibition of both cellular and clonogenic growth, and G(1) cell cycle arrest. Finally, thiazolidinedione treatment resulted in induction of p21(WAF-1) and increased expression of differentiation markers. These results suggest that thiazolidinedione treatment inhibits growth and induces cellular differentiation in pancreatic cancer cells and thereby reduces their development in favor of differentiated and stable cell phenotype."

Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the enzyme was localized in macrophages in lung and spleen, alpha-cells of pancreatic islet, zona glomerulosa cells of adrenal cortex, and neuronal cells of spinal cord and superior cervical ganglion. The presence of the 12-lipoxygenase in pancreatic alpha-cells was confirmed by glucagon staining in a consecutive section. We overexpressed the leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase cDNA in a glucagon-secreting alpha TC clone 6 cell line that had been established from a transgenic mouse. Glucagon secretion was stimulated by approximately twofold in the 12-lipoxygenase-expressing cells compared to the mock-transfected and original cells. The results suggest that the 12-lipoxygenase of the leukocyte type augments glucagon secretion from pancreatic islets."
