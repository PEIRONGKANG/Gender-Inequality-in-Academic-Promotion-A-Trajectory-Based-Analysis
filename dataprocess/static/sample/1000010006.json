                        "en": "Improvements in plant physiological performance by means of biochar application in soils contaminated by multi-elements are determinants of agroecosystem functioning. This study analyzed the effects of bamboo-derived biochar on root nodulation and plant growth in a moderately acidic Andosol (pH = 5.56) contaminated with multi-elements during a 70-day investigation of soybean growth. Bamboo biochar that had been pyrolyzed at a temperature below 500 °C was applied to soils at three different and moderately high rates (5%, 10%, and 15%, w/w). Biochar amendment beyond 5% stimulated root nodulation as well as soybean growth. The nodule weight per root system was significantly enhanced by 186% and 243% over the control at the 10% and 15% addition rates, respectively. The primary explanation for these stimulatory effects was attributed to an increase in the K and Mo supplies for plant uptake that was induced by the biochar application, whereas the increased availability of P contributed to a lesser extent. Leaf CO2 assimilation rate was slightly enhanced at the highest application rate, but this enhancement was not associated with an increase in biomass. The incorporation of biochar into the soil reduced extractable-NH4NO3 Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn, but not Pb, regardless of the application dose. This change was accompanied by a significant (P &lt\n 0.05) suppression of the uptake od trace elements in soybean shoots at the optimum application rate (10%)\n the degree of reduction followed this order: Pb&gt\nMn&gt\nCd&gt\nZn&gt\nCu&gt\nNi. The increase in soil pH and the diffusion/adsorption of trace elements onto the biochar may have contributed to the lowering of the concentration of trace elements in the soil as well as in soybean shoots."

                        "en": "The effect of varied concentrations of thermal-treated oyster shells (TOS) on the suppression of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) uptake and translocation into the shoots of maize plants was examined. Maize plants were grown in Cd- and Cu-contaminated Andosol for 70 days. The concentration of mobile Cd (extracted with 1 M NH4NO3) decreased with increasing TOS applications, whereas an increase in the concentration of mobile Cu in soil resulted from cumulative TOS additions. The addition of 2% TOS had no prohibitive effects on Cd uptake in maize shoots, but the 4 and 8% TOS treatments decreased Cd accumulation in shoots by 41 and 59%, respectively. The possible mechanisms underlying Cd suppression in maize shoots were the enhanced Cd adsorption caused by pH-induced increases in the negative charge of the soil and the antagonistic effects of Ca resulting from competition for exchange sites at the root surface. Cu accumulation in maize shoots increased by 34, 51, and 53% with the addition of 2, 4, and 8% TOS, respectively, but this increase was not observed for Cd accumulation. These results suggested that, in multi-metal-contaminated soils, attention should be paid to the potential mobility of target metals and the pH of the contaminated soil. From a plant physiological perspective, contaminated soils slightly reduced photosynthetic performance. However, the addition of TOS to the soil at levels higher than 4% substantially decreased photosynthetic performance, indicating that CaO-based suppressants at critical loads might damage the net photosynthetic rates of sensitive maize plants."

The present study was performed to investigate the effect of 6-nm IONPs and citrate-coated IONPs (IONPs-Cit) on photosynthetic characteristics and root elongation during germination of Glycine max (L) Merr. Plant physiological performance was assessed after foliar and soil IONPs fertilization. No adverse impacts at any growth stage of the soybeans were observed after application of IONPs. The Fe2O3 nanoparticles produced a significant positive effect on root elongation, particularly when compared to the bulk counterpart (IOBKs) suspensions of concentrations greater than 500 mg L-1. Furthermore, IONPs-Cit significantly enhanced photosynthetic parameters when sprayed foliarly at the eight-trifoliate leaf stage (P &lt; 0.05). The increases in photosynthetic rates following spraying were attributed to increases in stomatal opening rather than increased CO2 uptake activity at the chloroplast level. We observed more pronounced positive effects of IONPs via foliar application than by soil treatment. This study concluded that IONPs coated with citric acid at IONPs to citrate molar ratio of 1:3 can markedly improve the effectiveness of insoluble iron oxide for Fe foliar fertilization."

The experiment was conducted in concrete framed plots filled with sand obtained from the Dzungar desert or the normal field soil in Shihezi, Xinjiang, China. Drip irrigation with or without mulch was adopted for the experimental plots. The mean soil temperature in the sand plot with mulch was the highest among the plots during the early growth stages. The relative ureide-N content in the soil plots varied from 23.2% at the full flowering stage (R2) to 37.6% at the beginning of the maturity stage (R7). The sand plots showed higher values than the soil plots ranging from 48.7% at R2 to 80.5% at R7, indicating active N-2 fixation by nodules. Seed yield did not show a significant difference between the soil and the sand plots. It ranged from 394 g m(-2) in the soil plot without mulch to 472 g m(-2) in the sand plots with mulch. The results suggested the possibility of extending soybean cultivation into marginal areas of deserts, provided that adequate water was available for drip irrigation and there was active nodulation."

Five cultivars of cotton and six cultivars of peanut were grown in pots under two water levels; the control and water stress condition, where irrigation water equal to 100% and 50% of the daily transpiration, respectively, was daily applied. Peanut showed a greater increase than cotton in leaf temperature (T(L)) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and a greater decrease in water content per unit leaf area (WCLA), chlorophyll content and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm) in the water stress condition. On the other hand, the water stress lowered the transpiration rate, actual quantum yield of PSH (Delta F/F'm) and leaf area (LA) more in cotton than in peanut. Cotton showed greater reduction in LA along with little reduction in the root dry weight (RDW) leading to high WCLA, while peanut showed increased RDW with little reduction in LA under the water stress condition. It was concluded that photodamage and down regulation in PSII were induced by water stress, coinciding with increases in leaf temperature regulated mainly by transpiration. Peanut showed more severe photodamage in PSH than cotton under the water stress condition."

                        "en": "The relationships between photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were examined to assess suitability of PRI as a remote-sensing tool for the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. A greenhouse experiment was conducted using cotton and peanut crops under water stress condition. Five cotton and six peanut cultivars were grown using Andosole soil in pots maintained at two water levels\n the control and water stress treatment (WS) of 100 and 50% of the daily transpiration, respectively. Higher non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was exhibited by peanut than that of cotton by the water stress. On the other hand, the decreases of the actual quantum yield of photosystem II (ΔF/F'm) and PRI by the water stress in cotton were larger than those in peanut. There were positively significant correlation coefficients between PRI and ΔF/F'm in cotton at noon and in the afternoon including the control and WS. The correlations of PRI with NPQ were negatively significant at noon and in the afternoon for cotton, and in the afternoon for peanut. No clear relationship was found among these parameters in the morning probably due to the diurnal increase in global solar radiation. It was concluded that there would be a possibility to detect the effects of water stress on ΔF/F'm and NPQ by PRI with some exceptions, although PRI could not note varietals differences in ΔF/F'm and NPQ for each treatment. © 2010 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences."

                        "en": "The growth and seed yields of 2 Japanese and 3 Chinese cultivars of soybeans cultivated in 2002-2005 using a drip irrigation system in the arid area of Xinjiang, China, were analyzed with respect to growth parameters and air temperature. Seed yield was very high in 2002, 2003 and 2004, but relatively low in 2005. The variation among years in seed yield dearly depended on pod number. The mean leaf area index (LAI) and crop growth rate (CGR) in 2005 was lower than those in the other 3 years. CGR showed significant positive correlations with mean LAI at the early growing stages, and with net assimilation rate (NAR) at the later growing stages. The increasing rate of pod number (IRP) was positively correlated with the mean LA! and CGR at the pod setting period, suggesting that an adequate supply of photosynthates would be required for pod setting. It was concluded that excellent growth in the years with high yields was supported by the large LAI before the pod setting periods and by high NAR and vigorous pod growth at the latter half of the growing season."

The Japanese cultivars had short plant height with a large leaf area in the upper 2 or 3 layers from the top of the canopy (5∼15 cm). The Chinese cultivars had tall plant height with a small leaf area in each layer. The canopy of Chinese cultivars intercepted a larger amount of radiation than that of Japanese cultivars, due to higher values of intercepted radiation per unit leaf area despite smaller leaf area index. In particular, Huayu 16 intercepted a larger amount of radiation per unit leaf area in each layer than the other cultivars. Kanto 83 had the smallest light extinction coefficient mainly due to the small leaflet size, despite the dense leaf distribution. The CO2 assimilation rate and quantum yield of photosystem II in the later growing season were large in Kanto 83 and Huayu 16, which showed higher seed yields. Huayu 16 had effective characteristics for radiation interception, allowing it to maintain a high radiation use efficiency later in the growing season."

All cultivars showed a high leaf area index in 2002 and 2005, and it was around 5 in 2005. In 2003 with a low air temperature and less radiation from late June to August, all cultivars showed a small leaf area index as compared with that in 2002 and 2005. Except 2003, all cultivars had seed yields of more than 450 g m-2. In particular, Kanto 83 and Huaiku 16 showed a yield of more than 500 g m-2. Variation in total dry matter production depended on both amount of intercepted radiation and RUE. Crop growth rates during all growing periods but the early growing periods were mainly affected by RUE. Huayu 16 had the highest RUE values in 2002 and 2005 when higher seed yields were obtained, resulting in a high dry matter production and seed yields. The factors, that caused high seed yields of Huayu 16 and Kanto 83 in 2002 and 2005, were suggested to be rapid leaf area extension in the early growth stage, high RUE values, and large pod and seed numbers as a sink."

                        "en": "Abstract: A cotton cultivar Xinluzao 8 was grown under four levels of water stress treatments (normal irrigation, slight, mild and severe water stress) from the initial reproductive growth stage in Shihezi, Xinjiang, China, in 2002, to evaluate the growth and eco-physiological performances. Under water stress conditions, the transpiration ability decreased while the leaf temperature increased. Although the relative leaf water content decreased as water stress increased, the differences among the treatments were small, indicating that cotton has high ability in maintaining water in leaf. The stomatal density increased as water stress increased, while the maximum stomatal aperture reduced only in the severest stressed plants. The time of the maximum stomatal aperture was delayed in the mild and severe stressed plants. When severe stress occurred, the stomata were kept open until the transpiration decreased to nearly zero, suggesting that the stomata might not be the main factor in adjusting transpiration in cotton. Cotton plant has high adaptation ability to water stress conditions because of decrease in both stomatal conductance and hydraulic conductance from soil-to-leaf pathway. The actual quantum yield of photosystem II (PS II) decreased under water stress conditions, while the maximum quantum yield of PS II did not vary among treatments, suggesting that PS II would not be damaged by water stress. The total dry weight reduced as water stress increased. © 2007 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences."

                        "en": "Adaptive responses to diurnal changes in solar radiation and leaf movement restraint in soybean in comparison with cotton, which observes different heliotropism from that of soybean, were investigated in terms of leaf temperature (TL), Flow Rate of Stem Sap (FRSS), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs) and stomatal aperture. Cotton showed higher FRSS and E while smaller TL than that of restrained (RLM) and Not-restrained Leaf Movement (NRLM) soybean. The RLM soybean showed higher FRSS, E at noon and TL than that of NRLM soybean. Larger FRSS and E of cotton could be attributed to its higher stomatal density, stomatal aperture, gs and the diaheliotropic leaf movement. In NRLM soybean, smaller FRSS and smaller E at noon as compared with RLM soybean might be due to the smaller abaxial stomatal aperture, gs and the paraheliotropic leaf movement. It was concluded that cotton responded to increase in diurnal solar radiation by increasing its transpiration to reduce TL. Increase in transpiration of cotton was due to increase in the size of stomatal aperture, gs and the diaheliotropic leaf movement. NRLM soybean responded to increase in solar radiation by observing paraheliotropism in order to reduce its TL while RLM soybean increased its transpiration in order to reduce TL. Increase in transpiration of RLM soybean was due to increase in abaxial stomatal aperture. © 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information."

The yield potential in this area appears to be high if sufficient water is supplied. The yields of five soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) cultivars including three semi-indeterminate Chinese cultivars (Shidadou 1, Xindadou 1 and Suinong 11) and two determinate Japanese cultivars (Toyomusume and Toyokomachi) were evaluated over three years. These cultivars were grown under drip irrigation, a high planting density (22.2 plants m(-2)) and heavy applications of farmyard manure (15 t ha(-1)). Each cultivar showed a high leaf area index (LAI). In particular, the maximum LAI was greater than 7 over the three years in Shidadou I and Toyokomachi. The three Chinese cultivars with a high plant height had a low LAI in the upper layers of the canopy, but the two Japanese cultivars with a short plant height had a higher LAI in the middle or upper layers. Toyokomachi and Shidadou 1 had the highest seed yield, followed by Toyomusume. In particular, the seed yield of Toyokomachi was as high as 8.67 t ha(-1) on the average of the three years. These high-yielding cultivars had more than 60 pods per plant (1350 m(-2)). The high yields in this experiment could be due to the large amount of intercepted radiation owing to the high LAI and abundant solar radiation, frequent and sufficient irrigation by the drip irrigation, and large number of pods as a sink."

                        "en": "Adaptive changes were studied comparatively in soybean and cotton grown in pots under four irrigation conditions i.e. normal irrigation (equal to the evapotranspiration of the crop), and 50%, 25% and 10% of the normal irrigation. In soybean, the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) was generally higher while the actual quantum yield of PSII (Delta F/Fm') and CO2 assimilation rate (A(N)) were lower than in cotton. The intensity of the decrease in Fv/Fm, Delta F/Fm' and A(N) by water-stress treatments was larger in soybean than in cotton. The decrease in Delta F/Fm' in soybean under water stress was accompanied by a significant increase in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and significant decrease in photochemical reflectance index (PRI). Chlorophyll content decreased significantly tinder severe water stress only in soybean. The increase in leaf temperature (T-L) in response to water stress was significantly larger in soybean than in cotton. T-L was highly and negatively correlated with Fv/Fm, A(N), PRI and Delta F/Fm' while it was highly and positively correlated with NPQ of both crops. Especially in soybean, the correlations of T-L with A(N), Fv/Fm and PRI were significant. It was concluded that soybean adapted to water stress by dissipating the excess excitation energy thermally with the clown-regulation of PSII activity to protect its photosynthetic apparatus from the photodamaging effect of water stress and high T-L. This photoprotective mechanism might be supported by the paraheliotropic leaf movement of the crop. Cotton adapted to water stress by keeping T-L lower to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from photodamage. Probably higher transpiration kept T-L of the crop lower under drought stress."

Compared with cotton, soybean showed a lower flow rate of stern sap (FRSS), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (g(s)) stomatal density and A(N) and had a smaller stomatal area but larger leaf area, heavier root dry matter and higher T-L at all irrigation levels. Under water stress conditions, FRSS, E, g(s), and A(N) decreased and T-L increased more in soybean than in cotton. Stomatal area decreased in response to water stress though nonsignificantly but stomatal density was not affected by water stress in soybean. Stomatal area decreased significantly in response to water stress in cotton. We concluded that soybean and cotton adapted to water stress differently. Soybean adapted to water stress by reducing transpiration while cotton adapted to water stress by maintaining higher transpiration as compared with soybean. Soybean reduced the transpiration rate by reducing g(s). Reduction of g(s) in soybean was due to reduced FRSS, which might have resulted from the lower root moisture absorption efficiency. The higher transpiration in cotton was due to a higher g(s), which was supported by a higher FRSS, larger stomatal area, and probably the diaheliotropism. The higher g(s) and transpiration rate suppressed the increase in T-L thus preventing the decrease of A(N) in response to water stress."

Leaf temperature was higher in the morning and lower in the afternoon as compared with air temperature. There were large differences in the transpiration rate represented by the flow rates of stem sap per unit leaf area (FRSS) among the cotton cultivars. The transpiration rate in cotton generally depended on vapor pressure deficit (VPD). In the cultivars with a low transpiring ability, however, the influence of VPD was lower in the higher range of VPD. Cultivars with higher transpiring ability tended to have higher intercepted radiation per unit leaf area (IRL), i.e., to show active diaheliotropic leaf movement. The higher transpiring ability of cotton might be able to reduce heat stresses caused by diaheliotropic leaf movement and be profitable for yield under the and conditions."

In each cultivar the number of bolls per plant was low and the number of bolls per unit area was high. Each cultivar showed rather high seed and lint yields. The highest lint yield was Xinluzao 10 in both years with 1761 and 1809 kg ha(-1). High yield ability of the cultivars in this study was attributed to large number of bolls per unit area with high lint percentage. Seed and lint yields had significant positive correlations with mean net assimilation rate, ratio of reproductive to vegetative organs and mean boll weight at earlier stages of boll growth, suggesting that early boll formation and successive partitioning of dry matter into bolls were important factors for boll growth in this study area."

Application of PB at the start of the pod formation stage increased the percentage of podding, particularly in early-blooming flowers and seed yield. The major factor for this effect may be an acceleration of dry matter distribution to the early-bearing pods, which resulted from the inhibition of stem growth by PB. Application of PB at the early pod-formation stage increased chlorophyll content and Phi(PSII), resulting in enhanced CO2 assimilation rates. In the long term, PB tended to increase crop growth rate and net assimilation rate though not significantly. The effects of PB on the photosynthetic characteristics, however, were observed only during a short period at a restricted growing stage, suggesting that an increase in the photosynthetic rate would not be the main factor for the PB-induced increase in seed yield."

PB solution at a concentration of 100, 200 or 400 ppm was sprayed on foliage at the beginning of the pod formation stage (BPFS), the early pod fining stage (EPFS) and the middle pod fining stage (MPFS). The height of the plants treated with PB at BPFS and EPFS was shorter than that of the control plants by more than 10 and 5 cm, respectively. The pod number of the plants treated with 100 or 200 ppm PB at any developmental stage was higher than that of the plants treated with 0 or 400 ppm PB. The seed yield was increased by PB applied at any stage, and the yield after the treatment with 100 or 200 ppm PB at BPFS or EPFS was approximately 370 g m(-2)."

Five cultivars were grown in the upland field with drip irrigation and plastic mulch (DPB) as compared to the paddy field (CF). There was no significant difference in grain yield between CF and DPB, although physiological characteristics were slightly reduced in DPB in 2016. Water use efficiency tended to be large in DPB. In 2016 and 2017, greenhouse gas emissions in DPB were measured as compared to CF. The amount of methane gas emission in CF was 194% higher in 2016 and 69% higher in 2017 than DPB. The global warming potential (GWP) in DPB was 89% smaller than CF.

Varietal differences in leaf movement of soybean were also investigated under water stressed conditions, in Shihezi, Xingjiang, China. The effects of the treatment(restrained leaves horizontally)on leaf temperature and transpiration ability differed among cultivars. Leaf temperature was regulated by the combination of leaf movement and transpiration. The magnitudes of these two factors might differ among cultivars ; leaf temperature was regulated mainly by leaf movement, by transpiration and by both factors. There was also the soybean cultivar which could not control leaf temperature, because of its inactive leaf movement and low transpiration rate. Under water stressed conditions, there were large varietal differences of soybean in leaf movement, leaf temperature and transpiration rate as changing amount of irrigation. Intercepted radiation in the upper layrs of the canopy was larger in the irrigated plot as compared to the non-irrigated plot. Paraheliotropic leaf movement saved water loss by 71.3% in non-irrigated plot."

                        "en": "The purpose of this study is to clarify the physiological characteristics of annuals and perennials in the genus Oryza. W492, a strain of O. glaberrima, and Norin no. 22, a cultivar of O. sativa were compared to ascertain (i) the accumulation pattern of dry matter into panicles (ii) leaf senescence and (iii) translocation of assimilates into plant parts. We consider W492 to be annual because it dies within one year even under a 24hr photoperiod-12hr/12hr temperature of 25/20ﾟC and we consider Norin no. 22 to be perennial because it continues growing mare than one year under natural day length-day/night temperature of 25/20ﾟC.\nThe dry matter accumulation pattern in panicles was almost the same in both strains, though W492 was a little faster than Norin no. 22 at the early stage of ripenning. However, this was not in consonance with the results of the preliminary trial which showed that the accumulation of dry matter in panicles was much more faster in W492 than in Koshihikari (a cultivar of O. sativa). More experiments will be needed to confirm this fact.\nLeaf senescence indicated by chlorophyll content, SPAD values of a chlorophyll metre reading and nitrogen content was faster in W492 than in Norin no. 22. The difference in senescence between annual and perennial was very clear.\nThe rate of ^<13>C distributed to the various plant parts showed that the translocation of assimilates to panicles continued till later stage in Norin no. 22 than in W492. As the leaf area per plant of W492 decreased more rapidly than Norin no. 22, assimilating capacity per plant of W492 declined more sharply than Norin no. 22. Therefore, while Norin no. 22 was able to reserve some assimilates in the stubble during ripenning stage, W492 was not able to do so.\nMore detailed experiments are necessary to generalize the results on annuality and perenniality."
