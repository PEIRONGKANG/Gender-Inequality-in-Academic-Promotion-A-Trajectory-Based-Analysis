                        "en": "Background. Liver resection is currently accepted as the only potential cure for patients with metastases of colorectal tumors in the liver. However, cancer will recur in more than 70% of patients.\nMethods. In the 7 years to December 1997 60 patients underwent liver resections for colorectal metastases at our institute. Of these, 20 patients had repeated surgical resections for recurrent disease of the liver and other organs. Another 2 patients had undergone previous hepatectomy elsewhere. The clinical data for these patients were reviewed.\nResults. The median interval between the 2 resections was 16 months. Eighteen hepatectomies, 6 lung resections, and I pancreatoduodenectomy were performed in 22 patients. Operative mortality and complication rates were 0% and 18%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 25 months after repeated resection, the survival rate in these patients was 73% at 2 years (12 of IG evaluable patients are surviving) and 22% at 5 years (2 of 10 evaluable patients are surviving); the median survival time was 44 months.\nConclusions. Repeated resections for recurrent colorectal metastases yield comparable results to first liver resections in operative mortality and morbidity rates, survival time, and pattern of recurrence. Although the number of patients surviving more than 5 years is still limited, the absence of other proven treatments supports the concept of an aggressive reresectional approach for these patients."

                        "en": "Background Mass-forming type cholangiocarcinoma is a distinct form of cholangiocellular carcinoma, with pathologic and biologic behavior different from those of other types. The clinical consequences of these differences have never been clarified.\nMethods. Fifty-two consecutive patients (32 men and 20 women, mean age 62 years) with mass-forming type cholangiocarcinoma that had been treated with curative surgical resection between 1980 and 1998 were retrospectively evaluated. Long-term survival and disease-free survival were calculated, and univariate and multivariate analysis of various prognostic factors was conducted.\nResults. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 2 %, and the overall and disease-free 5-year survival rates were 36% and 34 %, respectively. Univariate analysis identified 5 significant risk factors for overall survival: surgical margin, lymph node metastasis, lymph node dissection, vascular invasion, and left-side location of the main tumor Two risk factors were identified for disease-free survival: surgical margin and lymph node metastasis. Multivariate analysis confirmed that surgical margin, lymph node metastasis, and vascular invasion were independently significant variables for overall survival.\nConclusions This is the first reported study on the effectiveness of liver resection for the treatment of mass-forming type cholangiocarcinoma, showing that surgical therapy can prolong survival if local radicality can be achieved and lymph-node metastases are absent."

                        "en": "Background. Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) remains an important cause of graft loss after liver transplantation. Emergency rearterialization methods are limited in cases of living-related liver transplantation in which the graft hepatic artery is thin and short.\nCase. A 19-year-old woman who underwent living-related liver transplantation for biliary atresia developed HAT on the 4th postoperative day. During the emergency laparotomy the recipient hepatic artery was found to be too short to anastomose, so the recipient's right gastroepiploic artery was anastomosed to the graft hepatic artery. The patient is now alive and well 6 months after reoperation, and she has experienced no further episode of HAT.\nConclusion. The right gastroepiploic artery can be used easily and safely for hepatic graft revascularization without causing ischemia of the stomach. An additional skin incision is not required, and the artery is long enough to anastomose to the graft artery directly. The method of hepatic graft rearterialization described here is an important option for patients who undergo living-related or split liver transplantation."

Several clinical risk factors have been reported to influence survival. Methods\nBetween March 1980 and December 1997, 235 patients underwent hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer. Survival rates and disease-free survival as a function of clinical and pathologic determinants were examined retrospectively with univariate and multivariate analyses.\nResults\nThe overall 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 51%, 38%, 26%, and 24%, respectively. The stage of the primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, and multiple nodules were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Disease-free survival was significantly influenced by lymph node metastasis, a short interval between treatment of the primary and metastatic tumors, and a high preoperative level of carcinoembryonic antigen. The 10-year survival rate of patients with four or more nodules (29%) was better than that of patients with two or three nodules (16%), and similar to that of patients with a solitary lesion (32%).\nConclusions\nSurgical resection is useful for treating liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Although multiple metastases significantly impaired the prognosis, the life expectancy of patients with four or more nodules mandates removal."

It is difficult to remove locally recurrent retroperitoneal malignant fibrous histiocytoma many times by repeat surgery, since the tumor tends to adhere tightly to the surrounding scar tissue. In the 5th and 6th operations we conducted on the patient, a harmonic scalpel was useful for separating the tumor from the scar tissue at the previous surgical site."

The portion of the small intestine that was fixed to the anterior abdominal wall was sonographically identified by using a high-frequency transducer to locate the area of restricted visceral sliding. The needle was then inserted into the intestine. In 3 cases, we have found that this technique improves the confidence of the physicians who perform the percutaneous drainage and may help to minimize the risks associated with the percutaneous drainage.

                        "en": "The surgery of living donor liver transplantation is more technically challenging than cadaveric whole liver transplantation and liver resection for the treatment of various pathological conditions. It requires a thorough understanding of the intra- and extra-hepatic anatomical relationships between the portal vein, hepatic artery, biliary tract, and hepatic vein, and also their respective contributions to liver physiology. Although a precise understanding of general anatomical principles is the key to correctly performing living donor liver transplantation procedures, anatomic anomalies are often present, and the means of detecting them and the surgical methods of coping with them represent technical challenges. In this monograph, we describe the anatomical keys and pitfalls of living donor liver transplantation surgery based on our own experience with more than 1800 hepatectomies, and 150 living donor liver transplantations. We also elaborate on techniques of selective intermittent vascular occlusion and their teleological and practical background."

                        "en": "The prognosis for patients with fulminant (FHF) or subfulminant hepatic failure (SFHF) has improved since the introduction of liver transplantation. However, the death rate of patients awaiting liver transplantation is high, possibly because of the difficulty in obtaining grafts in a timely manner, given the relative shortage of cadaveric donors. Between June 1990 and June 1999, 106 patients underwent living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) at Shinshu University Hospital. Among them, 8 patients had FHF and 6 had SFHF; these 14 patients are the subjects of this report. The graft volumes (GV) ranged from 231 mt to 625 mt, corresponding to 35% to 105% of the recipients' standard liver volume (SLV). The postoperative courses of all donors were uneventful. Following liver transplantation, all grafts functioned favorably, with normalization of serum total bilirubin within 3 to 5 days and normalization of coagulation profiles within 4 to 7 days. Thirteen of the 14 recipients are still alive. The actuarial 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year survival rates were 100%, 90%, and 90%, respectively. In the present study, when the ratio of the GV to the recipient's SLV was more than 35%, the graft was able to support the patient's metabolic demand after liver transplantation for FHF or SFHF Because of the urgent nature of liver transplantation in this clinical condition, concerns over informed consent may be even greater than for elective LRLT. Nevertheless, the high success rate and low donor risk may justify this option for pediatric patients, as well as for a limited population of adult patients suffering from FHF or SFHF."

                        "en": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are characterized by structural deterioration of aortic wall leading to progressive dilatation. The histopathological changes in AAAs are particularly evident within the elastic media, which is normally comprised mainly of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). There are vascular myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms; SM2 is specifically expressed in differentiated SMCs and SMemb is a nonmuscle-type MHC abundantly expressed in SMCs of the fetal aorta with an immature phenotype. Although AAA altered expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), pathophysiological role of SMC phenotypic modulation in the AAA progression remains uncertain. To determine whether phenotypic modulation in vascular SMCs contributes to arterial medial degeneration, we examined MHC expression in SMCs of AAA. Aortic specimens were obtained from patients with slowly progressed AAA (n = 12) and rapidly progressed AAA (n = 5), and compared with normal aortic tissue (n = 3). Immunohistochemical staining was performed for detection of SMemb, SM2, MMP (types 2 and 9) and TIMP (types 1 and 2). Faint SMemb and abundant SM2 were observed in normal aorta, while the balance shifted to SMemb predominance in AAAs. Compared with slowly progressed AAA tissue, rapidly expanded AAA tissue demonstrated marked increases in SMemb expression with suppressed SM2. Predominant SMemb expression indicates presence of phenotypic modulated SMCs and enhanced MMP; while abundant TIMP was seen in mature SMCs expressing SM2. SMemb expression is markedly increased in AAA with MMP enhancement, and a significant imbalance between SMemb and SM2 results in rapid progression of AAA. (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc."

                        "en": "BACKGROUND: Maintaining sufficient blood flow to the substitute organ after total esophagectomy is essential for decreasing the risk of anastomotic leakage. Additional venous, or arterial and venous, anastomoses between the vessels of the gastric tube and the vessels in the neck after total esophagectomy are described for 11 patients with cervical esophageal carcinoma.\nMETHODS: The tissue blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry before and after anastomosis. Venous anastomosis was performed for all 11 patients, and arterial anastomosis was added for 7 patients.\nRESULTS: A significant increase in tissue blood flow was observed after venous anastomosis alone (mean, 19%; P &lt; 0.05) and after arterial and venous anastomoses (mean 43%; P &lt; 0.01). There was no anastomotic leakage or hospital death.\nCONCLUSIONS: This procedure may reduce the risk of anastomotic leakage especially in the case of pharyngogastrostomy following total esophagectomy.

                        "en": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intrahepatic ducts from the left lateral segment of the liver are generally considered to run from the cranial to the umbilical portion of the left portal vein. This understanding often limits surgical exploration of the left hepatic ducts during both curative and palliative surgical procedures. The prevalence of ducts from the lateral segment running caudally to the umbilical portion was studied retrospectively on computed tomography (CT) films, and its clinical implications were evaluated.\nMETHODOLOGY: One hundred and sixty six DIC (drip infusion cholangiograhy) CT and 30 post-PTCD (percutaneous transhepatic cholangio-drainage) CT films taken during 4 consecutive years were reviewed giving special consideration to whether the ducts from the left lateral segment of the liver run caudal to the umbilical portion of the left portal vein.\nRESULTS: Corresponding variation was found in 3.6% of the DIC-CT examinations and in 3.3% of the CT examination after PTCD, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: The incidence of caudal left hepatic ducts with respect to the umbilical portion of the left portal vein was higher than expected from clinical experience. These results emphasize that more careful planning is necessary prior to hepatobiliary surgery."

Almost all pre-operative and intra-operative findings except for helical computed tomography were highly suggestive of malignant pancreatic tumor. However, the histopathology of the pancreas revealed caseating granulomatous inflammation of possible tuberculous etiology, although special staining and culture of these tissues gave negative results. Only detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA using the polymerase chain reaction-based assay gave a positive result which allowed antituberculosis treatment to be started. The patient's postoperative recovery has been uneventful without complications. If an early accurate diagnosis can be made in such cases, antituberculosis treatment can be started rapidly."

                        "en": "Background. Discrimination of malignant proximal bile duct (PBD) stricture from a benign lesion is difficult with nonsurgical methods; indeed, 8% to 13% of PBD strictures prove to be benign after histologic examination of the surgically resected specimen.\nMethods. In a 7-year period 178 patients with PBD stricture were admitted, and 99 of them underwent radical resection for presumably malignant lesions. In 14 of these patients the stenotic lesions were proved to be benign by postoperative histologic assessment. We reviewed these patients retrospectively by collecting data from their charts.\nResults. Preoperative radiologic findings including cholangiography and angiography wee compatible with malignancy in all 14 patients. Preoperative histologic studies suggested malignancy in 2 of 8 examined. Findings at laparotomy could not allow differentiation between malignant and benign lesions in any of the patients and strongly suggested malignancy in 3. Histologic examination of the resected specimens revealed extensive fibrosis with inflammatory cellular infiltration in all patients. There was 1 episode of significant morbidity postoperatively (transient cholangitis) but no mortality.\nConclusion. Benign PBD strictures, although rare, are usually indistinguishable from malignant PBD strictures by preoperative or perioperative investigation. Given the minimal morbidity, all PBD strictures should be presumed malignant and managed accordingly, even at the risk of overtreating some benign cases."

                        "en": "Preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) was performed in 84 patients before extensive liver resection for various diseases. By the criteria of liver volumetric determination, some patients were candidates for PVE, whereas others were not, even though the same surgical procedure, such as extended right lobectomy (ERL), was scheduled. PVE using gelatin sponge powder induced hypertrophy in the nonembolized lobe (0%-171%; median, 30%) and proportional atrophy in the embolized lobe in 2 weeks without eliciting any major inflammatory or necrotic reaction, as evidenced histologically and by the minimal elevations in the serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) values. Alterations in the total bilirubin level and prothrombin time were also insignificant and transient, indicating that hepatocyte functions were not impaired by PVE. Not all patients who undergo PVE proceed with the scheduled hepatic resection procedure, so it is a great advantage that gelatin sponge causes minimal damage compared with other embolizing materials such as cyanoacrylate and absolute ethanol, which have been reported to induce an inflammatory reaction or histological alteration. Our multiple regression analysis showed that three factors, diabetes mellitus, a high total bilirubin level at the time of PVE, and being male, each reduced the extent of hypertrophy in the nonembolized lobe (r(2) = .30). By contrast, cholestasis appeared to accelerate the process of atrophy in the embolized lobe (r(2) =,16). In conclusion, PVE by gelatin sponge powder is a safe and effective preoperative maneuver that induces hypertrophy of the section of the Liver that will remain after partial hepatectomy."
