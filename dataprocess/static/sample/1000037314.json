From investigations of how PRL inhibits Xenopus tail regression in vitro , it was found that the both hormones could, in addition to their known antimetamorphic actions, upregulate mRNA expression of type III iodothyronine 5-deiodinase (5D), an enzyme that inactivates thyroid hormones (TH). Conversely, both PRL and GH were found to downregulate 5D mRNA expression in the liver. Blockage by PRL of TH-induced tail regression in organ culture was released by treatment with iopanoic acid (IOP, an inhibitor of 5D activity). The IOP-released tail regression displayed a unique morphology of the larger fins retained on the regressing tails, consistent with the finding that mRNA for both PRL receptor and 5D were enriched in the fin. The results suggest that the metamorphosis-modulating actions of PRL and GH are mediated, at least partially, by tissue-specific regulation of 5D mRNA expression."

                        "en": "Guanabenz, an I-2-imidazoline-related compound with high affinity for intestinal membrane of the eel (Kim et al., 1998), enhanced the transepithelial potential difference (PD) and short-circuit current (Isc) from serosa to mucosa after pretreatment with isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), serotonin (5-HT) and methacholine (MCh). The mucosal effect of guanabenz was not mimicked by adrenaline, indicating that the mucosal guanabenz binding site is not adrenoceptors. The mucosal guanabenz enhanced the Ise in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar enhancement in the Ise was also obtained after addition of other imidazoline derivatives such as ST93, clonidine, ST91, naphazoline and UK14,304 into the mucosal fluid. On the other hand, the effect of guanabenz was completely blocked by mucosal RX821002 or efaroxan, another imidazoline derivatives. Since some imidazoline derivatives act as agonists and others as antagonist, there must exist imidazoline receptor on the mucosal side of the eel intestine. Accompanied by an increase in the PD, NaCl and water absorption across the intestine was also enhanced by mucosal guanabenz. To search for endogenous ligands for the imidazoline receptor, luminal fluid in the intestine of the seawater eels was collected. However, most luminal fluid was ineffective. Only one among 10 samples showed guanabenz-like activity, suggesting that the endogenous ligands is secreted into the lumen under restricted condition alone."

                        "en": "Since highly concentrated NaCl is suspected to enter into the heart of the seawater eels, effects of high NaCl concentration on the atrial beating was examined, and plasma ion concentrations and osmolality were measured simultaneously in the blood collected from the bulbus arteriosus and from the caudal vessels. When 100 mmole l(-1) NaCl was added to the incubation medium, atrial contraction was enhanced significantly. Similar enhancement in the atrial contractility was also observed after addition of NaCH3SO4 (100 mmole l(-1)) or Tris HCl (100 mmole l(-1)), indicating that Na+ and Cl- are not indispensable for the positive inotropic effect. Furthermore, an addition of sucrose (200 mmole l(-1)) also enhanced the contraction. Inversely, hypoosmotic solution reduced the atrial contraction. These results indicate that the eel atrium is sensitive to environmental osmolarity. The eel atrium responses even at 20 mmole l(-1) sucrose. Such an inotropic effect of sucrose was not depressed after blocking adrenoceptor with betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, indicating that the effect is not due to adrenaline release from nerve endings. Plasma osmolality and Na+ concentration were higher in bulbus arteriosus than in caudal vessels, indicating that the eel heart is really exposed to hyperosmotic blood in sea water. The osmotically enhanced atrial contraction may increase the cardiac outflow into the gill. Such property of the atrium would have clear advantages for seawater teleosts, since the concentrated NaCl from the esophagus can be excreted immediately through the gill, without circulating their body, and blood homeostasis can be maintained efficiently."

Ali these effects are mediated by its cell surface receptor. However, lack of information on PRL receptor (PRL-R) gene expression has made the physiological importance of the PRL/PRL-R system obscure in amphibian metamorphosis. Hence, a Xenopus PRL-R cDNA was cloned, its structure was characterized, and specific binding of PRL to Xenopus PRL-R expressed in COS-7 cells was confirmed. In adult tissues, high level expression was found in the lung, heart, brain, thymus and skin, and low level in the oviduct, kidney and spinal cord. The developmental expression pattern showed that PRL-R messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was expressed in the brain and tail from premetamorphesis and the level increased toward late metamorphosis, suggesting that PRL may inhibit the metamorphic changes in those organs. The level of brain PRL-R mRNA reached a peak just at the start of the metamorphic climax stages and then decreased, whereas in the tail, mRNA expression peaked at late metamorphosis. In the kidney, mRNA expression increased and reached a maximum level at the end of metamorphosis. The results obtained were discussed in relation to metamorphosis."

The mucosal effect of guanabenz was not mimicked by adrenaline, indicating that the mucosal guanabenz binding site is not adrenoceptors. The mucosal guanabenz enhanced the Ise in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar enhancement in the Ise was also obtained after addition of other imidazoline derivatives such as ST93, clonidine, ST91, naphazoline and UK14,304 into the mucosal fluid. On the other hand, the effect of guanabenz was completely blocked by mucosal RX821002 or efaroxan, another imidazoline derivatives. Since some imidazoline derivatives act as agonists and others as antagonist, there must exist imidazoline receptor on the mucosal side of the eel intestine. Accompanied by an increase in the PD, NaCl and water absorption across the intestine was also enhanced by mucosal guanabenz. To search for endogenous ligands for the imidazoline receptor, luminal fluid in the intestine of the seawater eels was collected. However, most luminal fluid was ineffective. Only one among 10 samples showed guanabenz-like activity, suggesting that the endogenous ligands is secreted into the lumen under restricted condition alone."

                        "en": "Since highly concentrated NaCl is suspected to enter into the heart of the seawater eels, effects of high NaCl concentration on the atrial beating was examined, and plasma ion concentrations and osmolality were measured simultaneously in the blood collected from the bulbus arteriosus and from the caudal vessels. When 100 mmole l(-1) NaCl was added to the incubation medium, atrial contraction was enhanced significantly. Similar enhancement in the atrial contractility was also observed after addition of NaCH3SO4 (100 mmole l(-1)) or Tris HCl (100 mmole l(-1)), indicating that Na+ and Cl- are not indispensable for the positive inotropic effect. Furthermore, an addition of sucrose (200 mmole l(-1)) also enhanced the contraction. Inversely, hypoosmotic solution reduced the atrial contraction. These results indicate that the eel atrium is sensitive to environmental osmolarity. The eel atrium responses even at 20 mmole l(-1) sucrose. Such an inotropic effect of sucrose was not depressed after blocking adrenoceptor with betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, indicating that the effect is not due to adrenaline release from nerve endings. Plasma osmolality and Na+ concentration were higher in bulbus arteriosus than in caudal vessels, indicating that the eel heart is really exposed to hyperosmotic blood in sea water. The osmotically enhanced atrial contraction may increase the cardiac outflow into the gill. Such property of the atrium would have clear advantages for seawater teleosts, since the concentrated NaCl from the esophagus can be excreted immediately through the gill, without circulating their body, and blood homeostasis can be maintained efficiently."

                        "en": "A pituitary hormone, prolactin (PRL) shows various effects on cellular metabolism in amphibians, such as stimulation of larval tissue growth and inhibition of metamorphic changes. Ali these effects are mediated by its cell surface receptor. However, lack of information on PRL receptor (PRL-R) gene expression has made the physiological importance of the PRL/PRL-R system obscure in amphibian metamorphosis. Hence, a Xenopus PRL-R cDNA was cloned, its structure was characterized, and specific binding of PRL to Xenopus PRL-R expressed in COS-7 cells was confirmed. In adult tissues, high level expression was found in the lung, heart, brain, thymus and skin, and low level in the oviduct, kidney and spinal cord. The developmental expression pattern showed that PRL-R messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was expressed in the brain and tail from premetamorphesis and the level increased toward late metamorphosis, suggesting that PRL may inhibit the metamorphic changes in those organs. The level of brain PRL-R mRNA reached a peak just at the start of the metamorphic climax stages and then decreased, whereas in the tail, mRNA expression peaked at late metamorphosis. In the kidney, mRNA expression increased and reached a maximum level at the end of metamorphosis. The results obtained were discussed in relation to metamorphosis."

                        "en": "Intravenous administration of eel angiotensin II (eANG II), histamine (HA), serotonin (5-HT), acetylcholine (ACh) or carbachol (CCh), mammalian substance P (mSP) and isoproterenol (P-adrenoceptor agonist) enhanced drinking rate in the seawater eels. The dipsogenic effects of HA and 5-HT seem to be due to ANG II synthesis, because these effects were completely blocked by captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Captopril blocked eANG I effect, but not eANG II effect, suggesting existence of ACE in seawater eels. 800 mu l Hemorrhage also enhanced water intake, and this effect was completely blocked by captopril. Therefore, it is likely that blood withdrawal stimulates renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in seawater eels. Effects of ACh, CCh and mSP were not inhibited by captopril, suggesting separate action of these regulators from ANG II synthesis. Isoproterenol action was partially inhibited by captopril, suggesting existence of some P-adrenoceptors other than the RAS. On the other hand, intravenous eel atrial natriuretic peptide (eANP), arginine vasotocin (AVT), human vasoactive intestinal peptide (hVIP), mammalian bradykinin (mBK), eel intestinal pentapeptide (EIPP), cholecystokinin (CCK-8), and phenylephrine (alpha-adrenoceptor agonist) depressed the drinking rate. In the presence of mBK, HA and 5-HT enhanced water intake similarly as in the absence of mBK. Plasma hyperosmolarity also reduced drinking. Although the in vivo system is so complicated and many regulators are involved in the drinking behavior, a possible regulatory mechanisms are proposed. Compared to mammalian results, eels seem to be a suitable model for anlayzing drinking mechanisms in vertebrates."

                        "en": "We examined the expression and localization of type-II 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Type-II thiolase acts on 3- oxoacyl-CoA esters with a methyl group at the α carbon, whereas conventional thiolases do not. Mammalian type-II thiolase, which is also termed sterol carrier protein x (SCPx) or SCP2/3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase, is located in the peroxisomes and involved in phytanic acid degradation and most probably in bile acid synthesis. The nematode enzyme lacks the SCP2 domain, which carries the peroxisomal-targeting signal, but produces bile acids in a cell-free system. Northern and Western blot analyses demonstrated that C. elegans expressed type-II thiolase throughout its life cycle, especially during the larval stages, and that the expression was significantly enhanced by the addition of clofibrate at 5 mM or more to the culture medium. Whole-mount in situ hybridization and immunostaining of L4 larvae revealed that the enzyme was mainly expressed in intestinal cells, which are multifunctional like many of the cell types in C. elegans. Subcellular fractionation and indirect immunoelectron microscopy of the nematode detected the enzyme in the matrix of peroxisomes. These results indicate the fundamental homology between mammalian SCPx and the nematode enzyme regardless of whether the SCP2 part is fused, suggesting their common physiological roles."

                        "en": "A Xenopus AMBP (xAMBP) cDNA clone was isolated from a subtracted liver cDNA library by differential hybridization screening. The deduced amino acid sequence shared 50-60% identity with its mammalian counterparts, which are the precursors of the plasma glycoproteins, alpha 1-microglobulin and bikunin. Both peptide structures were well conserved in xAMBP. Northern and in situ hybridization revealed that the xAMBP gene was specifically expressed in liver parenchymal cells. The gene was activated around embryo hatching and repressed at the metamorphic climax stage. During adult life the mRNA level remained low. Treating the tadpoles with thyroid homone prematurely reduced the mRNA level. Furthermore, thyroid hormone acted on larval hepatocytes in primary culture and reduced the mRNA level. Thus, xAMBP gene expression appears to be repressed through the direct action of thyroid hormone on the hepatocytes at the metamorphic climax stage. On the other hand, adult hepatocytes in thyroid hormone-free culture medium expressed mRNA at a low level, which was not reduced in response to thyroid hormone, suggesting that the repressed xAMBP gene expression in adult hepatocytes was maintained in a thyroid hormone-independent manner. The unique expression profile suggested that the xAMBP gene plays a biological role in the progression of amphibian metamorphosis."
