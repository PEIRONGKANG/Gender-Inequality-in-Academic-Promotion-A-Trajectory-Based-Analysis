                        "en": "Apoptosis regulates inflammatory cell survival in allergic inflammation, and decreased apoptosis contributes to the chronicity of inflammation. To investigate the mechanisms of onset and remission of mite-sensitive childhood asthma, we evaluated peripheral blood mononuclear cell apoptosis in patients with asthma and in remission.\nThere was a similar percentage of hypodiploid cells in unstimulated mononuclear cell cultures from patients with active asthma (29.5 +/- 5.0%) and normal individuals (25.9 +/- 14.9%). In contrast, the percentage increased in patients in remission (44.5 +/- 3.2%). In Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) antigen-stimulated mononuclear cell, the stimulation index was lower in patients with active asthma (0.95 +/- 0.06%) than in normal individuals (1.31 +/- 0.16%). In contrast to active patients, the proportion of hypodiploid cells stimulated with Df in patients with remission was equivalent to that of normal controls. After phyto-hemaglutinin (PHA) stimulation, the percentage of hypodiploid cells in patients with active asthma (35.1 +/- 3.2%) was also lower than in normal individuals (48.5 +/- 4.3%) or patients in remission (49.5 +/- 5.7%).\nApoptosis occurred predominantly in CD8(+), but not CD4(+), cells inpatients in remission. Interleukin IL-2 inhibited apoptosis in Df-activated cells in normal individuals, whereas IL-2 did not inhibit apoptosis in cells from patients in remission as well as with active asthma.\nThe expression of Fas receptors on resting mononuclear cells was similar in the three groups. However, Fas receptor expression in Df-stimulated mononuclear cells was greater in patients with active asthma than it? healthy individuals. In patients with remission that was equivalent to healthy controls. The PHA increased Fas expression to a similar degree in the three groups. With regard to Fas ligand, the expression was lower in unstimulated cultured mononuclear cells from patients than in normal individuals. In patients in remission that was comparable to normal individuals. The Df stimulation upregulated the Fas ligand in patients with active asthma, and downregulated it in patients in remission. In conclusion, apoptosis in Df-stimulated mononuclear cells is impaired in patients with active asthma, while spontaneous apoptosis of CD8(+) cells in vivo is augmented in patients in remission, and may be involved in the onset and remission of mite-sensitive asthma."

                        "en": "Apoptosis regulates inflammatory cell survival in allergic inflammation, and decreased apoptosis contributes to the chronicity of inflammation. To investigate the mechanisms of onset and remission of mite-sensitive childhood asthma, we evaluated peripheral blood mononuclear cell apoptosis in patients with asthma and in remission.\nThere was a similar percentage of hypodiploid cells in unstimulated mononuclear cell cultures from patients with active asthma (29.5 +/- 5.0%) and normal individuals (25.9 +/- 14.9%). In contrast, the percentage increased in patients in remission (44.5 +/- 3.2%). In Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) antigen-stimulated mononuclear cell, the stimulation index was lower in patients with active asthma (0.95 +/- 0.06%) than in normal individuals (1.31 +/- 0.16%). In contrast to active patients, the proportion of hypodiploid cells stimulated with Df in patients with remission was equivalent to that of normal controls. After phyto-hemaglutinin (PHA) stimulation, the percentage of hypodiploid cells in patients with active asthma (35.1 +/- 3.2%) was also lower than in normal individuals (48.5 +/- 4.3%) or patients in remission (49.5 +/- 5.7%).\nApoptosis occurred predominantly in CD8(+), but not CD4(+), cells inpatients in remission. Interleukin IL-2 inhibited apoptosis in Df-activated cells in normal individuals, whereas IL-2 did not inhibit apoptosis in cells from patients in remission as well as with active asthma.\nThe expression of Fas receptors on resting mononuclear cells was similar in the three groups. However, Fas receptor expression in Df-stimulated mononuclear cells was greater in patients with active asthma than it? healthy individuals. In patients with remission that was equivalent to healthy controls. The PHA increased Fas expression to a similar degree in the three groups. With regard to Fas ligand, the expression was lower in unstimulated cultured mononuclear cells from patients than in normal individuals. In patients in remission that was comparable to normal individuals. The Df stimulation upregulated the Fas ligand in patients with active asthma, and downregulated it in patients in remission. In conclusion, apoptosis in Df-stimulated mononuclear cells is impaired in patients with active asthma, while spontaneous apoptosis of CD8(+) cells in vivo is augmented in patients in remission, and may be involved in the onset and remission of mite-sensitive asthma."

                        "en": "Background: Whether normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) transferred to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice produce specific IgE remains unclear.\nMethods: Mice received injections of Dermatophagoides farinae antigen (Df)-stimulated PBMCs from healthy persons (IgE RAST score of 0).\nResults: High titers of Df-specific IgE were detected. The Df-specific IgE activity produced was comparable to or higher than that produced by cells from patients with asthma although the time to maximal production was longer. IgE derived from PMBCs of healthy persons or patients with asthma induced histamine release from Cultured human basophils that had been stimulated with Df antigen or an anti-IgE antibody. Treatment of Df-stimulated PBMCs with a high dose, but not a low dose, of interleukin-4 stimulated production of Df-specific IgE by PMBCs from healthy persons or patients with asthma. In contrast, intravenous injection of IFN-gamma into reconstituted SCID mice decreased Df-specific IgE production by PBMCs from patients with asthma. In PMBCs from healthy persons, IgE class-switching may occur later and block the effects of treatment with IFN-gamma.\nConclusions: PBMCs from healthy persons and persons with asthma have clones reactive to allergen and produce functional IgE specific for relevant antigens in mite-sensitive bronchial asthma."

                        "en": "Background: Whether normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) transferred to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice produce specific IgE remains unclear.\nMethods: Mice received injections of Dermatophagoides farinae antigen (Df)-stimulated PBMCs from healthy persons (IgE RAST score of 0).\nResults: High titers of Df-specific IgE were detected. The Df-specific IgE activity produced was comparable to or higher than that produced by cells from patients with asthma although the time to maximal production was longer. IgE derived from PMBCs of healthy persons or patients with asthma induced histamine release from Cultured human basophils that had been stimulated with Df antigen or an anti-IgE antibody. Treatment of Df-stimulated PBMCs with a high dose, but not a low dose, of interleukin-4 stimulated production of Df-specific IgE by PMBCs from healthy persons or patients with asthma. In contrast, intravenous injection of IFN-gamma into reconstituted SCID mice decreased Df-specific IgE production by PBMCs from patients with asthma. In PMBCs from healthy persons, IgE class-switching may occur later and block the effects of treatment with IFN-gamma.\nConclusions: PBMCs from healthy persons and persons with asthma have clones reactive to allergen and produce functional IgE specific for relevant antigens in mite-sensitive bronchial asthma."

However, how it interferes with allergic responses is unclear. To investigate the mechanisms of action of RXM, lymphocyte transformation and interferon (IFN)-gamma interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 synthesis associated with Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) mite antigen in patients with bronchial asthma were evaluated in vitro in the presence of RXM. T cell proliferation in Df antigen-stimulated patients' lymphocytes was suppressed by 50-100 mug/ml of RXM. Production of IL-4 and IL-5 was similarly decreased by 1-10 mug/ml RXM, whereas, IFN-gamma production, which was reduced by Df-stimulation alone, was increased by 50 mug/ml RXM. Our results suggest that skewed cytokine profiles of patients with mite antigen-induced bronchial asthma may be corrected with RXM. which may mimic those of patients in remission, who are tolerant of Df antigen.

At 1 year and 1 month of age, the patient presented with anaphylaxis, including erythema, which was initially localized to the contact site of the anterior chest, and wheezing accompanied by dyspnea, 5 min after contact with milk allergen through his atopic skin. These symptoms continued for 50 min. Seventy minutes after the disappearance of the initial erythema, the patient developed subsequent erythematous lesions distributed throughout the neck and head area that persisted for as long as 24 h. On another occasion, he also exhibited a pale face and generalized erythema immediately after an accidental oral ingestion of milk at the age of 1 year and 8 months. He had been unsettled for several hours when an intravenous steroid was administered. His serum IgE was 590 IU/mL and the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) scores against milk, α-lactoalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, casein and cheese were 5, 2, 3, 5 and 5, respectively. This is a rare case of a patient with milk allergy who fell into anaphylaxis following both cutaneous contact with and oral ingestion of the offending milk protein. Care should be taken with patients with food allergies because cutaneous contact with the offending food may cause adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis."

                        "en": "Milk allergy in a 1-year and 8-month-old boy is reported. At 1 year and 1 month of age, the patient presented with anaphylaxis, including erythema, which was initially localized to the contact site of the anterior chest, and wheezing accompanied by dyspnea, 5 min after contact with milk allergen through his atopic skin. These symptoms continued for 50 min. Seventy minutes after the disappearance of the initial erythema, the patient developed subsequent erythematous lesions distributed throughout the neck and head area that persisted for as long as 24 h. On another occasion, he also exhibited a pale face and generalized erythema immediately after an accidental oral ingestion of milk at the age of 1 year and 8 months. He had been unsettled for several hours when an intravenous steroid was administered. His serum IgE was 590 IU/mL and the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) scores against milk, α-lactoalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, casein and cheese were 5, 2, 3, 5 and 5, respectively. This is a rare case of a patient with milk allergy who fell into anaphylaxis following both cutaneous contact with and oral ingestion of the offending milk protein. Care should be taken with patients with food allergies because cutaneous contact with the offending food may cause adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis."
