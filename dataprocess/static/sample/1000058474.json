                        "ja": "Examining Sei Ito's reception of James Joyce's Ulysses, we cannot help having a sense of discomfort. Considering few references cannot be available to him, we cannot reproach him for his misunderstanding of Joyce's works. Ignoring this fact, however, it seems meaningless to say Joyce had certain influences upon Ito. In fact, however, most critics talk about Joyce's influence on Ito uncritically. It may be very difficult for those who do not specialize in Joyce to understand his works precisely, but we can find little criticism against Ito's understanding of Joyce even in Sei Ito by Hideaki Oketani, who wrote James Joyce, a literary criticism about Joyce. The purpose of this paper is to re-examine Ito's understanding of Joyce's works, especially Ulysses, to consider some problems about Japan's reception of foreign literature."

                        "ja": "In Ulysses, Joyce described a day in Dublin. His description is very realistic in a way. For instance, in the ninth episode, 'Scylla and Charybdis', persons who really existed appear under their real names; A.E. (George Russell), John Eglinton (William K. Magee), Mr. Best (Richard Best), and so on. Of course, Ulysses is not real, but a fiction. If nobody knows everything that really happened, however, what is the difference between the real and fiction? Historians may try to describe' historical facts' as they are, but they have to interpret history and give significance to 'historical facts' according to their interpretations. In Ulysses, \"the Phoenix Park murders\" are referred to several times. These murders were carried out in the park on 6 May 1882. The murderers, members of a Nationalist society called the Invincibles, killed two British Officials, Lord Frederick Cavendish, chief secretary for Ireland, and Mr. Thomas Henry Burke, an undersecretary in Dublin Castle. In the seventh episode,' Aeolus', referring to this murder case, Myles Crawford, an editor of the Evening Telegraph, recounts the efforts of Ignatius Gallaher, a journalist who also appears in Dubliners, to convey details of the event to the New York World newspaper. All this time Stephen Dedalus regards it as a scene from the bloody history repeated between Ireland and the British Empire, referring to it as a \"Nightmare from which you never awake\". In the 12th episode,' Cyclops',' Citizen', a nationalist, praises the murderers as\" martyrs\". Thus it is suggested that' historical facts' are given different meanings from different viewpoints. Suggesting this awareness, Joyce seems to try to undermine the authority of historical statements, and to show that history can be re-read and re-written. The purpose of this paper is to show through examining the text structure of Ulysses that, while writing his story, Joyce also tried to re-write Irish history."

He comes out of the blue on the cemetery scene in Episode 6 (Hades), and, thereafter, appears twelve times in Ulysses. Leopold Bloom wonders over and over again who he is. And yet, in the text, we can find some hints as to his identity. It seems an enigma presented to the reader as well as to Bloom. Most plausible answers to this question seem to be Mr Duffy from 'A painful Case' in Dubliners and the author, Joyce, himself, because the text suggests it. These answers, however, cannot be proved definitely in spite of some suggestions we can find in the text. And we cannot decide which is the right answer, Mr Duffy or the author. What is important about this question, however, does not seem to be the exact answer to it, but what we notice in the course of our attempt to solve the question: we cannot but notice the fact that Ulysses has various narrative levels. This enigma seems to function as a meta-language suggesting one of the important features of narrative structure of Ulysses."

                        "ja": "Bloom's father was a Jew. He left Hungary as \"a wandering Jew\", and arrived at Dublin in 1865. Next year, Bloom was born. His wife, Molly, was born in Gibraltar in 1870, and grew there until she moved to Dublin with her father when sixteen. His father, Brian Tweedy, was an Irish and her mother probably a Spanish Jew. Bloom and Molly got married in 1888. Ulysses is an Irish novel and describes the people in Dublin. Then, why are these main characters Jewish? The purpose of this paper is to examine the meaning of Bloom, the protagonist of this novel, being a Jew.原著Original国立情報学研究所で電子化"
