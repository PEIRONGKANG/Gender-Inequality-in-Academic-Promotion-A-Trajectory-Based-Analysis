The region of the COO- antisymmetric stretching vibration provides information about the coordination modes of a COO- group to a metal ion. The 34-residue peptide corresponding to the EF hand motif (helix-loop-helix) showed a band at 1552 cm(-1) in the Ca2+-loaded state, indicating that the side-chain COO- group of Glu at the 12th position serves as a ligand for Ca2+ in the bidentate coordination mode. On the other hand, the 13-residue peptide (Ac-DRDADGYIDAEEL-NH2) containing the Ca2+-binding site III (DRDADGYIDAEE) did not show such spectral patterns in the Ca2+-loaded state, meaning that shorter synthetic peptide corresponding to the site III has less or no affinity for Ca2+. It was found that the 17-residue peptide (Ac-DRDADGYIDAEELAEIF-NH2) is the minimum peptide necessary for the interaction of side-chain COO-of Glu at the 12th position with Ca2+ in the bidentate coordination mode. We discuss the relationship between the amino acid length of synthetic peptide analogues and the formation of Ca2+-bound coordination structure. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

                        "en": "In order to reveal the requirements for amino acid sequences prone to form amyloid fibrils, a novel prediction method based on the original structural model of amyloids was developed. As a working hypothesis, two fundamental conditions were introduced into the design of the present system for the evaluation of the propensity for amyloidogenicity. The first of these two conditions was to ensure that the hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between residues on neighboring antiparallel beta-strands were formed along a fibril axis. The other condition was that the hydrophobic interacting residues appeared on both faces of the protofibril, which gave line-matching interactions. Most peptides with sequences exhibiting high scores, as evaluated by this method, were found to easily form amyloids with the aid of a turn-inducing structure designed as a connection of two beta-strands. On the other hand, peptides with low-scoring native sequences and those modified by an internal residue-residue exchange (the latter yielding a null score) did not lead to amyloid formation. These data demonstrated the validity of this method for the prediction of amyloid structures. Moreover, the present study provided support for the proposed model of the essential structure associated with the above working hypothesis. The predicted high-scoring regions were in good agreement with the putative amyloid core regions reported thus far. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "The role of the peripheral sequence neighboring the core cross-P region was investigated using a peptide library constructed with all possible combinations of Lys, Glu, Ser, and Leu at three residue positions (X1-X3) forming the N-terminal region linked to the amyloid core sequence of the barnase-derived segment (A4-K22). By means of CD spectra and thioflavin T binding assay for 64 peptides, not only the composition but also the sequence in the peripheral region were found to be responsible for amyloid formation. The preferences of amino acid residues in the peripheral region of the amyloid-forming peptides were in the order of Leu approximate to Ser &gt;= Glu &gt;&gt; Lys. A balance of positive and negative charges was found to be essential for amyloid formation, suggesting that the electrostatic interaction at the surface of the amyloid fibrils is relevant to their stability. On the basis of the maximum fluorescence wavelength of fibril-bound thioflavin T, the highly amyloidogenic peptides were classified into two classes, which exhibited the sequence preferences of (Leu, Ser/Glu, and Leu) and (Glu, Leu, and Ser) for the peripheral sequence (X1, X2, and X3). The former class can be rationally assigned to the structural model with deep grooves along the fibril axis. Thus, the peripheral sequence regulates the manner of molecular packing in the fibrils as well as the amyloiclogenicity. In addition, the chains of the peripheral sequence are most likely to form thioflavin T binding sites. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "The dimeric structure of kinesin superfamily proteins plays an important role in their motile functions and characteristics. In this study, the coiled-coil-forming property of the stalk region (192-346) of Drosophila ncd, a C-terminal kinesin motor protein, was investigated by synthesizing various peptide fragments. The alpha helicity of a set of 46-residue peptides spanning the stalk region appeared too low to form a coiled-coil dimer, probably because of insufficient continuity of the hydrophobic residues at (a and d) core positions in amphipathic heptad repeats. On the other hand, several peptides with leucine residues introduced at core positions or with extensional sequences with high cc helicity had an advantage in coiled-coil formation. When we analyzed the thermal and urea-induced unfolding of these dimeric peptides, we identified four domains having a relatively high potential to form coiled coils. Among them, three domains on the C-terminal side of the stalk region, i.e., (252-272), (276-330), and (336-346), were in the same heptad frame, although these potential coiled-coil domains were not self-sustaining individually. This is in sharp contrast to the fragment of human kinesin, (332-369), which has an extremely high tendency toward coiled-coil formation. One of the possible triggers for coiled-coil formation of the ncd stalk region may be the interaction between the motor domain and the C-terminal part of the stalk as previously revealed by X-ray crystallography. The residues, S331 and R335, seem to act as a breaking point for a-helix continuity. This would make the region (336-346), as the head-stalk joint, more flexible such as seen with a plus-end-directed kinesin, if this region had no interaction with the motor domain. These characteristic differences between tied and kinesin suggest that the nonlocally sustained coiled coil of ncd is one of the factors important for minus-end-directed motility."

                        "en": "Unc104/KIF1A, a kinesin family member, is reported to be monomeric in solution, though its polypeptide has regions that potentially form coiled coils. For a better understanding of the mechanism underlying Unc104/KIF1A's motility, it is important to evaluate the dimerization ability of this protein. The CD measurement of relevant segments of Caenorhabditis elegans Unc104 indicated that peptides having a common region (N358-K379) showed spectra characteristic to an alpha-helix. Dimerization by coiled-coil formation was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. By analyzing the concentration dependence of the CD spectra, the monomer dimer dissociation constant, K-d, of (N354-E388) was estimated to be about 5 mu M, which is considerably larger than that of the corresponding segment of human kinesin (62 nM). Though its dimerization ability is rather moderate, Unc104/KIF1A could nonetheless dimerize and therefore could move by the same mechanism as human kinesin when the concentration of Unc104 is high due to, e.g., local crowding. This suggests that the motility could be controlled by the concentration of the motor protein. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Porphyrin-containing DNA solid films with several binding orientations were successfully prepared by drying the aqueous solution of porphyrins and DNA in a magnetic field. By the measurement of linear dichroism absorption spectra from three identical spatial directions, the molecular orientations of porphyrins in chainaligned DNA films were evaluated. Tetra(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl)-porphyrin was found to be bound at the surface of DNA chains like a patch. This orientation is different from the intercalative or groove binding manners observed in solutions. In contrast, tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)-porphyrin exhibited an orientation perpendicular to the DNA axis, which may be attributed to H-aggregation of porphyrins along the direction parallel to DNA chains. Heme-protein with coiled coil backbone was also aligned along the DNA chains, orienting ferric protoporphyrin parallel to the magnetic field. The major effect for these molecular orientations would be the molecular packing of the rod-disk or the rod-rod systems."

                        "en": "Novel composite films of chain-oriented DNA, which contain the DNA-binding dyes aligned in specific orientation, were successfully prepared by drying the solution under a horizontal magnetic field. Most of the dye-DNA composite films showed linear dichroism, as revealed by polarized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The intercalators, ethidium bromide and acridine orange, were fixed in chain-oriented DNA films in a similar binding manner as in solutions. Also, Hoechst 33258 and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were found to be aligned along the minor groove, even in the solid films. Thus, our new method of preparing dye-DNA composite films with chain orientation is useful for aligning small molecules, and it will provide views of the novel anisotropic materials expected in various application fields. We used this method to prepare composite DNA films with newly designed original compounds. Seven of nine dyes were judged to bind obviously to DNA as intercalators by polarized UV-vis spectroscopy. The DNA-binding manners were further analyzed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements. On the basis of the curves for the rotational angle dependence of the anisotropy, we were able to estimate the angles between the transition-dipole moments of dyes and the aligned chain axis of DNA. Interestingly, two original compounds were found to be in the tilted forms with regard to the plane of base pairs. We emphasize here that the method using aligned dye-DNA films is very convenient for identifying the binding modes of the compounds for double-stranded DNA."

                        "en": "ncd is a molecular motor belonging to the kinesin superfamily. In solution, it is a homo-dimer of a 700 amino acid polypeptide. The C-terminus of each polypeptide forms a globular domain of about 40 kDa, the motor domain with ATPase activity. The ATPase site of the motor domain of kinesin family members, including ncd, binds ADP tightly, the release of which is facilitated by microtubules during the mechanochemical ATPase cycle. Previously, we studied the spectroscopic characteristics of the ncd motor domain, focusing on interactions of the transition-moment-dipoles between ADP and aromatic amino acid side chains using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. In the present study, we generated several ncd motor domain mutants. In each, a tryptophanyl or specific tyrosyl residue was mutated. We found that Trp370 and Tyr442, the latter of which stacks directly with the adenine moiety of bound ADP, caused the bound ADP to exhibit peculiar CD signals. In addition, fluorescence measurements revealed that Trp370, but not Trp473, was responsible for the emission intensity change depending on the presence or absence of bound ADP, This fluorescence result implies that the structural change induced at the ADP-binding site (on the release of the ADP) is transmitted to the region that includes Trp370, which is relatively close to the ADP-binding site but not in direct contact with the ADP-binding region. In contrast, Trp473 in the region that is in contact with the a-helical coiled coil stalk did not experience the structural changes caused on removal of ADP The distinct behavior of these two tryptophanyl residues suggests that the ncd motor domain has a bifacial architecture made up of a relatively deformable side including the nucleotide binding site and a more rigid one."

                        "en": "Various mutants of the protein fragment, barnase module-1 (1-24) were investigated in order to reveal the structural principle of amyloid-like fibrils. By means of circular dichroism. spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and thioflavin T binding assay, we found that the molecules containing two beta-strands and an intervening turn structure are assembled to form a cross-beta structure. Stabilization by both the hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding between the respective paired side-chains on the coupled beta-strands was essential for fibril formation. These two types of interaction can also arrange the corresponding residues in lines on both sheet surfaces of protofilaments with a cross-beta structure. This leads to the most probable fibril structure constructed with the line-matching interactions between protofilaments. Consideration of the geometrical symmetry resulted in our finding that a limited number of essential models for molecular packing in fibril structure are stable, which would rationally explain the occurrence of two or three morphologies from an identical molecular species. The ribbon-like fibrils exhibited striped texture along the axis, which was assigned to a stacked two-sheet repeat as a structural unit. The comprehensively proposed structural model, that is, the sheet-sheet interaction between left-handed cross-beta structures, results in a slightly right-handed twist of beta-sheet stacking, which reasonably elucidates the intrinsic sizes of the fibril width and its helical period along the fibril axis, as the bias in the orientation of the hydrogen-bonded beta-strand pair at the lateral edge is larger than that at the central protofilament.

                        "en": "The molecular orientation of DNA membranes, which were prepared by subjecting diluted solution of salmon sperm DNA to a natural drying process, was examined. X-ray diffraction and polarization microscopy revealed that the dried membranes have zonal structures. Each zone shows different features in molecular orientation. In the outer zones formed at the early stage in drying, DNA molecular chains were found to be aligned along the annular curve of the peripheral edge. Both the uneven thickness and disproportional molecular weight distribution in a membrane suggested that the radial flow transported DNA molecules to the edge and that they formed the accumulated phase. Above the critical concentration for the formation of liquid crystalline, the DNA chains would be aligned onto the preformed solid-liquid interface. The membranes with the highest birefringence were obtained from DNA samples with the relatively high molecular weight of around 29 kbp. In the innermost zone, on the other hand, the DNA molecules were radially oriented. This alignment can be attributed to the hydrodynamic effect caused by the rapid translation of the edge interface, which overcomes the Brownian motion of the chain segments. A transitive balance of physical effects was revealed in the dry process, which provided quite orthogonal molecular orientations in a single droplet. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

                        "en": "Bacterial proteins A and G (SpA and SpG) are immunoglobulin receptors that can be used as probes for monitoring change in the conformation of heavy chain constant.(CH) domains. Interaction of anti-(4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyi)acetyl (NP) antibody (Ab) with SpA and SpG were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance in order to address the question of whether hapten-binding induces a conformational change in the CH domain. The interactions of IgG2a or its enzymatic fragments with SpA were measured in the presence or absence of the hapten. Although binding of Fab and F(ab')(2) fragments were not observed to free SpA, they did bind to immobilized SpA. In addition, the association constant (K,) for interaction of IgG2a with immobilized SpA was approximately 20-fold higher than that with free SpA. This was explained in terms of high avidity resulting from multivalent interaction between IgG2a and immobilized SpA on the chip. Interestingly, the hapten-binding weakened the interaction between the F(ab')2 fragment and SpA. Furthermore, approximately half of the IgG2a was incapable of binding to immobilized SpA in the presence of hapten. These results were explained using a model which assumed the formation of two kinds of SpA/IgG complexes; one through sites on F(ab')2 arms and the other through sites on the Fc region. The former type dissociated as a result of hapten-binding, as did the F(ab')2 fragment and suggested that a conformational change had occurred around the Fab arms, while the latter type did not dissociate because of the higher avidity of the Fc region. However, using a mutant SpA with a lower K-a value for the interaction with IgG2a, it was shown that hapten-binding induced long range conformational changes in the Fc region of IgG2a. Similar evidence of conformational change upon hapten-binding was also obtained using SpG as a probe. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "DNA films showing highly homogeneous orientation of mol molecular chains were successfully prepared by drying a semidiluted solution in a horizontal magnetic field. Most of the molecular chain elements in the obtained film were found to be one-dimensionally oriented, as shown by X-ray diffraction, polarization microscopy, and linear dichroism spectroscopy. Because a DNA chain is theoretically expected to orientate only in divergent directions perpendicular to a magnetic field, this result suggests that the DNA chains were aligned not only by a magnetic field but also by the interfacial effect that induced the chains to fit along the air-liquid interface. The descent speed of an air-liquid interface by evaporation was faster than the estimated diffusion rate of DNA, suggesting an emergence of a concentrated layer near the surface. As proved by polarization microscopy, this emergence led to the transitional formation of a nematic-like liquid crystalline phase, which resulted in a DNA film with good chain alignment and unitary orientation. This mechanism underlying chain alignment was supported by molecular weight dependency, in which higher molecular weight DNA is more likely to evince chain alignment that exhibits a higher degree of birefringence. Low molecular weight components have such high thermal motility that it would be difficult to fit them along the air-liquid interface in the early stage of drying. For chain alignment, it was preferable to use an initial concentration of DNA lower than a critical concentration for liquid crystal formation so that the possible diffusion and assembly in a diluted solution would be essential for chain alignment. The DNA film exhibited obvious linear dichroism, indicating the potential for further applications."

The peptide folds into a unique structure in water and shows a cooperative thermal transition, both of which may be hallmarks of a protein. Also, the experimentally determined beta-hairpin structure was very close to what we had targeted. The performance of the short peptide not only implies that the methodology employed here can contribute toward development of novel techniques for protein design, but it also yields insights into the raison d'etre of an autonomous element involved in a natural protein. This is of interest for the pursuit of folding mechanisms and evolutionary processes of proteins."

                        "en": "In order to analyze the secondary structures of protein molecules adsorbed on gold surfaces, circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured and the secondary structure contents of protein ultra-thin films were estimated quantitatively. A disulfide group was introduced to cytochrome h(562) (cyt.b562), which is a water-soluble b-type heme protein. The cyt.b562 molecules self-assembled to form an ultra-thin protein film both on a gold substrate modified with 2,2'-dithiodiacetic acid and on a bare gold surface. CD measurements were carried out both in solution and in air, and these results were compared. The protein denaturation was partially prevented, not only in solution but also in air, by both the modification of the substrate and the introduction of the anchor group to the protein molecule. The secondary structure contents of ultra-thin protein films on flat gold surfaces were observed for the first time both in solution and in air by CD spectra. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Biosensor assays on interactions between these proteins and mouse IgG specific to (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl (NP) or their enzymatic fragments conducted in the presence or absence of the hapten, NP-epsilon-aminocaproic acid (NP-Cap), showed that the binding of IgG to these proteins was inhibited by the binding of NP-Cap. The results of isothermal titration calorimetry also revealed that the association constant for the interaction of protein A with IgG2b decreased by the addition of NP-Cap. These results suggested that antigen binding induced conformational changes in binding sites for protein G or protein A located at C(H)1 and C(H)2-C(H)3 domains, respectively."

                        "en": "The thermal stability of the murine MHC class II molecule, I-A(b), in complex with invariant chain-derived peptide (CLIP) and an antigenic peptide derived from the alpha subunit of the I-E molecule (Ealpha) at mildly acidic and neutral pH were analyzed using circular dichroism (CD). The stability of I-A(b)-CLIP was increased by a single amino acid substitution in the P1 anchor residue, from Met of CLIP to Phe of Ealpha, similar, in this respect, to I-A(b) -Ealpha. This indicates that hydrophobic interaction in the P1 pocket is critical and plays a primary role in the stability of the complex. The structural models of I-A(b)-peptides based on the crystal structure of I-A(d) might explain the increased stability and the preference for hydrophobic residues in this site. Taken together with what is known of the resident stability at a mildly acidic pH, the difference in stability would closely correlate with the ability of MHC class II to exchange peptides from CLIP to antigenic peptides in the endosome.

                        "en": "Cavities or packing defects in proteins may generally be related with the dynamics and function of a protein. In the c-Myb R2 subdomain, its single cavity has been shown to be crucial for its DNA recognition. Cavities are also considered important in determining the pressure stability of a protein. In the present work, high-pressure proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy at 750 MHz is used to study the effect of a cavity-filling. mutation (V103L) on the stability of the c-Myb R2 subdomain in the pressure range between I and 3,700 bar at 5 degreesC. A dramatic increase in the pressure stability of the c-Myb R2 subdomain is attained, from which we estimate the cavity size to be 35.3 Angstrom (3), in good agreement with literature values. We also evaluated the increase in thermodynamic stability DeltaG(1bar)(0) from 5.35 kJ/mol to 7.34 kJ/mol by the mutation, giving a clear example of the effect of a cavity on the global stability of a globular protein.

                        "en": "We have recently generated a new mutant of cytochrome b(562) (cytb(562)) in which Met7, one of the axial heme ligands, is replaced by Ala (M7A cytb(562)). The M7A cytb(562) can bind heme and the UV-Visible absorption spectrum is of a typical high-spin ferric heme. To investigate the effect of the lack of Met7 ligation on the structural integrity of cytb(562), thermal transition analyses of M7A cytb(562) were conducted. From the thermodynamic parameters obtained, it is concluded that the folding of M7A cytb(562) is comparable to the apoprotein despite the presence of heme. On the other hand, exogenous ligands such as cyanide and azide ions are readily bound to the heme iron, indicating that the axial coordination site is available for substrate binding. The peroxidase activity of this mutant is thus examined to evaluate new enzymatic function at this site and M7A cytb(562) was found to catalyze an oxidation reaction of aromatic substrates with hydrogen peroxide. These observations demonstrate that the Met7/His102 bis-ligation to the heme iron is crucial for the stable folding Of cytb(562), whereas the functional conversion of cytb(562) is successfully achieved by the loose folding together with the open coordination site."
