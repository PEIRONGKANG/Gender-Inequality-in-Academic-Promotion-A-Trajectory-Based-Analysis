                        "en": "In powder-forged ferrous materials, surface defects such as decarburized layers, surface roughness, and non-sintered areas (NSA) are observed. These NSA, peculiar to this material, play the most important role in determining the mechanical properties.\nIn order to understand the behavior of NSA in dynamic conditions, fractography and measurement of the NSA distribution on the fatigue origin were investigated. The behavior of crack initiation and propagation was observed during fatigue tests by using ACPD (the alternative current potential drop method) measurement and the thermoelastic stress analysis system. The effects of NSA on fatigue properties were discussed on the basis of fracture mechanics.\nAs a result, the mixture of static fracture with fatigue in fatigue origin indicates that process of fatigue fracture consist of 3 stages as follows:\n1st stage; effective crack initiation (combination of NSAs by static and fatigue fracture)\n2nd stage; propagation of effective crack\n3rd stage; final rupture\nObservations of fatigue crack initiation and propagation with the crack growth monitoring system show that the fatigue fracture process consist of 3 stages mentioned above and effective crack initiation occurred at the beginning of less than 10% of fatigue life. From the measurement of NSA distribution of fatigue origin, the fatigue behavior of this material can be treated with fracture mechanics based on the effective crack length equal to the depth of NSA distribution of which NSA ratio is 14%."

As a result, it was found that the complex plane plot of the impedance is composed of two semicircles. The diameter of the smaller semicircle (high-frequency side) was almost the same for all specimens, but that of the larger semicircle (low-frequency side) was different between bulk end specimens and bulk center specimens. This impedance variation from specimen to specimen agrees well with those of the bending strength. From the composition analysis of each specimen, it was found that the bending strength and the diameter of the low-frequency semicircle is affected by the content of free carbon assumed to exist at the grain boundaries. Possible evaluation of the material properties of SiC by impedance spectroscopy seems to be promising.",
