                        "en": "An anaerobic rod-shaped thermophile was isolated from a hydrothermal vent at Suiyo Seamount, Izu-Bonin Arc, western Pacific Ocean, and was named strain MN14(T). The rods were Gram-negative-staining, non-motile without flagella, 2-4 mu m long and 0.5 mu m wide, and divided by binary fission in the mid-exponential phase. The cells were surrounded by a sheath-like structure (toga) and occurred singly or in chains. Spheroids containing multiple cells were observed not only in the stationary phase, as previously observed for species of the order Thermotogales, but also from the early exponential phase. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the peptidoglycan in rods partly disintegrated in the early growth phases and that the outer membrane of the spheroids was not completely lined with peptidoglycan. These findings suggested that the spheroids were formed from rods by the disintegration of peptidoglycan and subsequent inflation of the outer membrane. The spheroids eventually generated tiny cells in the periplasmic space, indicating a viviparous mode of proliferation in addition to binary fission. Strain MN14(T) grew at 40-75 degrees C, pH 5.0-8.2 and with 0.25-5.20% (w/v) NaCl, with optimal growth occurring at 68 degrees C, pH 6.8 and with 2.5% NaCl. The shortest doubling time was 24 min, assuming that the strain propagated only by binary fission. Elemental sulfur enhanced growth, but was not essential. Thiosulfate was not an electron acceptor for growth. The strain was a chemo-organotroph that grew on yeast extract as the sole growth substrate. Tryptone and starch supported its growth in the presence of yeast extract. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 31.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that this strain belonged to the genus Thermosipho. No significant DNA-DNA hybridization was observed between the genomic DNA of strain MN14(T) and phylogenetically related species of the genus Thermosipho. Based on this evidence, strain MN14(T) is proposed to represent a novel species, named Thermosipho globiformans sp. nov. The species epithet globiformans reflects the formation of multicellular and reproductive spheroids by the novel strain. The type strain of this species is MN14(T) (=JCM 15059(T)=DSM 19918(T))."

The core lipid of PL-Y was caldarchaeol, and that of PL-X was archaeol. The composition of the hydrocarbon chains of the PL-T core lipid was C-20 phytane and C-40 isoprenoid in a molar ratio of 2 to 1. The major molecular species of the C-40 isoprenoid was acyclic without the cyclopentane ring. These three kinds of intact phospholipids commonly had glycerophosphate residues as polar head groups. The structure of PL-T was characterized as trialkyl-type caldarchaetidylglycerol, PL-Y as caldarchaetidylglycerol, and PL-X as archaetidylglycerol."

The chemical components of GPL-K were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography and GC-MS. The sugar moiety of GPL-K and its anomeric region were analyzed by NMR assignment. The core lipid of GPL-K was caldarchaeol, and its main hydrocarbon chains were acyclic and monocyclic C-40 biphytanyl. The polar head groups were alpha-glucose and glycerophosphate. The negative FAB-MS spectrum of GPL-K confirmed that the lipid peak of m/z 1614 consists of a caldarchaeol (including one cyclopentane ring), a hexose sugar, and a glycerophosphate. We have proposed the tentative structure of GPL-K. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

The tentative structures of these lipids were characterized by the combination of gas-liquid chromatography, the methylation procedure, and H-1-NMR and FAB-mass spectrometries. The lipophilic portion of the neutral glycolipids was composed of a simple molecular species named caldarchaeol (dibiphytanyl-diglycerol tetraether). The sugar moieties of these glycolipids were composed of gulose and glucose which formed monosaccharide residues on one side or both sides of the core lipids. Gulose was attached to the terminal glycerol OH group of the core lipid with a beta-configuration and glucose being attached with an ct-configuration. The proposed structure of GL-la was gulosylcaldarchaeol and that of GL-lb was glucosylcaldarchaeol. The structures of GL-2a, GL-2b, and GL-2c were the analogs of the caldarchaeol derivatives attached by a variety of gulosyl residues or glucosyl residues on both sides of the terminal OH groups.

                        "en": "Three spherical thermoacidophilic archaea (strains TA-1(T), TA-13, TA-14) were obtained from acidic hot springs located in Ohwaku Valley, Hakone, Japan. All the isolates are facultatively anaerobic, and grew optimally at around 85 degrees C, ph 2.0. Isolate TA-1(T) was characterized further. The G+C content of DNA from TA-1(T) is 33 mol%. Although these properties resemble those of the genus Acidianus, the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene from strain TA-1(T) was more similar to that of species of Stygiolobus than of Acidianus. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments also indicated that strain TA-1(T) is clearly distinguished phylogenetically from the members of Acidianus, Sulfolobus and Metallosphaera. On the basis of the distinct physiological and molecular properties, we describe the new strains as members of the new genus Sulfurisphaera. The type species of the genus is Sulfurisphaera ohwakuensis, and the type strain of the species is TA-1(T) (= IFO 15161(T))."

PL-X as intact dialkyl-diether-type lipid, and PL-Y and PL-Z as intact trialkyl-tetraethertype lipids were newly found. The structure of PL-X was a diether analog of phosphatidyl inositol, and both PL-Y and PL-Z were also phosphoinositol lipids, in the former, one inositol-monophosphate was linked to glycerol on one side of the core lipid, and in the latter, inositol-monophosphates were linked to glycerols on both sides of the core. There may possibly be a pathway in which tetraether type lipids are biosynthesized through PL-Y, following the production of PL-Z from two molecules of PL-X. PL-X content constituted about 5% the total lipids ; PL-Y and PL-Z were present as less than 1% total lipids in <I>S. acidocaldarius</I> N-8."

However, the characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry showed that the structure of calditol in calditoglycerocaldarchaeol is not nonitol, 2-(1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl)1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydroxyhexane, but 2-hydroxymethyl-1-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)2,3,4,5-cyclopentanetetraol with an ether linkage in the molecule. Such an intermolecular ether linkage was resistant to BCl3 treatment, but nonresistant to 57% Hl degradation treatment conducted at 100 degrees C for 60 h, producing 2-hydroxymethyl-1,2,3,4,5-cyclopentanepentaol from calditol as reaction product. Further, it was confirmed that the structure of calditol is essentially a derivative of glycerol, and hydrocarbon chains were conjugated to the glycerol-like site in the structure. The calditol with an ether linkage in the molecule suggested an important role regarding the properties of heat-resistance and acid-resistance observed in Sulfolobales."

We have studied the isolates using electron microscopy, Gram staining, sensitivity to lysozyme, growth conditions, lipid compositions, SDS-PAGE patterns of whole-cell proteins, DNA base composition and partial 16S rRNA sequences. These characteristics of the isolates were compared with those of the type strains, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, Sulfolobus solfataricus, Acidianus brierleyi, Acidianus infernus, Metallosphaera sedula and Desulfurolobus ambivalens. Comparative studies indicated that the isolate TA-1 was novel species of either Sulfolobus or Acidianus, the isolate TA-2 belonged to the genus Metallosphaera, and the isolate N-8 belonged to the same species of S. acidocaldarius isolated from Yellowstone."

Survival values of Halobacterium, Haloferax, Haloarcula, Halococcus, Natronobacterium, Thermoplasma, Sulfolobus and Acidianus were more than 5% after drying and more than 0.04% after being stored at 37-degrees-C for 2 weeks. The survival values of these dried specimens after long-term preservation at 5-degrees-C corresponded to those estimated from the results of the accelerated storage test. Therefore, it is considered that the accelerated storage test is useful for estimating the stability of the dried specimens of archaebacteria during preservation and that the dried specimens of even the most fragile bacterium, Thermoplasma, will remain viable for more than 15 years when they are kept at 5-degrees-C."

For the quantitative determination of lipid phosphorus, an organic phosphate is converted to an inorganic phosphate by perchloric-nitrate digestion, which then made into an ammonium phosphomolybdate complex.Absorbance of the complex extracted with ethyl acetate/butyl acetate (9 : 1, vol/vol) was determined at 310 nm. A liner relationship between 0.051.00μg of phosphorus and absorbance was found.<BR>This two-dimensional TLC method was carried out using synthesized <I>P, P</I>'-bis (1, 2-dihexadecylether-<I>sn</I>-glycerol-3-) -pyrophosphate as the internal standard. It was possible to analyze the phospholipid composition of soybean lecithin by this method using only 50μg of crude lipid extract."

                        "en": "A spherical thermoacidophilic archaeon, strain TA-2, was obtained from acidic hot springs located in Ohwaku Valley, Hakone, Japan. This isolate is an obligate aerobic chemoorganoheterotroph that grows optimally at about 75 degreesC, pH 2.8. The G + C content of DNA from TA-2 is 47mol%. The 16S rRNA gene from TA-2 showed more than 99% similarity with those of Metallosphaera sedula and Metallosphaera prunae and less than 92% similarity with other members of the order Sulfolobales. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments showed more than 93% genomic DNA homology among TA-2, M. sedula DSM5348(T), and M. prunae DSM10039(T). However, TA-2 lacks calditoglycerocaldarchaeol derivatives, which are usually found in the membrane lipids of members of the order Sulfolobales. Therefore, calditoglycerocaldarchaeol may not be essential for survival in thermophilic and acidophilic environments. The isolate was deposited as Metallosphaera sedula TA-2 (JCM 9064, IFO 15160)."

                        "en": "Living organisms on the Earth which are divided into three major domains - Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya, probably came from a common ancestral cell. Because there are many thermophilic microorganisms near the root of the universal phylogenetic tree, the common ancestral cell should be considered to be a thermophilic microorganism. The existence of a cell is necessary for the living organisms; the cell membrane is the essential structural component of a cell, so its amphiphilic property is vital for the molecule of lipids for cell membranes. Tetraether type glycerophospholipids with C-40 isoprenoid chains are major membrane lipids widely distributed in archaeal cells. Cyclization number Of C-40 isoprenoid chains in thermophilic archaea influences the fluidity of lipids whereas the number of carbons and degree of unsaturation in fatty acids do so in bacteria and eucarya. In addition to the cyclization of the tetraether lipids, covalent bonding of two C-40 isoprenoid chains was found in hyperthermophiles. These characteristic structures of the lipids seem to contribute to their fundamental physiological roles in hyperthermophiles. Stereochemical differences between G-1-P archaeal lipids and G-3-P bacterial and eucaryal lipids might have occurred by the function of some proteins long after the first cell was developed by the reactions of small organic molecules. We propose that the structure of lipids of the common ancestral cell may have been similar to those of hyperthermophilic archaea. (C) 2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
