Pressure and temperature inside the compressor are assumed to be approximately 6.0 MPa and 150 degrees C, respectively, in the worst practical situation.

A previous study evaluated the suppression effect of inhibitors such as R32 and R13I1; herein, we explored an optimized inhibitor composition that simultaneously fulfills the requirements of excellent suppression of the disproportionation reaction under the worst practical condition and low GWP. R290 was selected as a new inhibitor owing to its extremely small thermal decompo-sition energy. Subsequently, suppression of the disproportionation reaction was investigated using mixtures of R290 and HFO-1123.

Accurate predictions of ultra -lean combustion require a proper LFS correlation. This work proposes a novel LFS equation for a 5-component gasoline surrogate to refine a quasi-dimensional (QD) combustion model predictivity in two highly efficient gasoline engines dedicated to next-generation hybridized vehicles. First, micro-gravity constant volume vessel experiments are performed to measure the LFS of the 5-component gasoline surrogate for equation validations (equivalence ratio phi = 0.55 - 1.0 at elevated temperature and pressure). Calculated data using conventional (LFS_conv), refined (LFS_ref), and novel (LFS_nov) functions are compared with the measured, literature, and 1D kinetics data. LFS_conv computes zero or negative flame speeds under ultra-lean and ultra-rich mixtures, and over-predicted LFS values are obtained for the entire range. Computed data of LFS_ref and LFS_nov are properly validated with measured, literature, and 1D kinetics values. The refined and novel LFS correlations are embedded into the QD combustion model. The combustion model fidelities are compared using the three LFS equations in predicting the combustion and performance characteristics of the engines (conventional-port engine A: phi = 1.0 to lean-limit, strong-tumble engine B: phi = 0.5 - 1.0). For engine A, predicted combustion and performance using LFS_conv are obtained with average relative errors delta conv up to 47.6 %. Maximum delta ref = 18.2 % and delta nov = 12.8 % are obtained using LFS_conv and LFS_ref, respectively. For the long-stroke engine B model, LFS_nov produces the highest prediction accuracy with delta nov <= +/- 6 %.

Importance of more than one active PGM surface site occupations at the adsorption step of C(2)H(4)or C(3)H(6)and multiple-sited stable intermediate CH(x)species are considered. Gas phase experimental results show that the light-off temperature as well as complete conversion temperature of both C2H4/O(2)and C3H6/O(2)mixture shift to lower side with the increase in oxygen concentration. The surface species analyses show the presence of stable intermediate CH(x)species and linearly adsorbed CO on the platinum surface.

                        "en": "In this study, reaction characteristics of C2H4/O(2)and C3H6/O(2)on practical Pt/Al(2)O(3)monolith catalyst are investigated, and a simplified microkinetic surface reaction mechanism is proposed by taking the observed surface species and their occupied active surface sites into account. Importance of more than one active PGM surface site occupations at the adsorption step of C(2)H(4)or C(3)H(6)and multiple-sited stable intermediate CH(x)species are considered. Gas phase experimental results show that the light-off temperature as well as complete conversion temperature of both C2H4/O(2)and C3H6/O(2)mixture shift to lower side with the increase in oxygen concentration. The surface species analyses show the presence of stable intermediate CH(x)species and linearly adsorbed CO on the platinum surface. Numerically simulated light-off performance with the proposed reaction mechanism shows good agreement with the experimental results of C2H4/O(2)and C3H6/O-2. Moreover, simulation results also agree well with the additional experimental results with multiple gas compositions and validate the proposed detailed reaction mechanism."

The conventional conversion rate experiments for gaseous CO to CO2 were conducted with the monolith honeycomb catalyst, and furthermore, the adsorbed surface species were identified with the powdered catalyst by in-situ FTIR under the same conditions as conversion rate experiment. As a result, it was found that only linear CO adsorption was detected for Pt, while twin CO adsorption was detected for Rh. Based on the results, detailed surface reaction mechanisms have been developed for Pt/Al2O3 and Rh/Al2O3. As a result of numerical simulation, it was confirmed that the variations of CO to CO2 conversion rate with temperature were quantitatively reproduced for various O-2 concentration conditions. Furthermore, using those reaction mechanisms, CO conversion rate on bimetal, Pt/Rh Al2O3 catalysts were examined for several Pt/Rh ratios. Numerical simulation results for bimetal catalysts were also quantitatively agreed with experimental results for various Pt/Rh ratios as well as CO/O-2 ratios.",

IDTs of normal nonane (n-C-9 ), 2-methyloctane (2mC(8)), 2,4-dimethylheptane (24mC(7)), and 2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentane (2244mC(5)) are experimetally obtained by a shock tube facility and numeri-cally simulated by a chemkin 0-D reactor model. Further, laminar flame speeds (SL) of n-C-9 and 2244mC(5) are measured by spherical expanding flames in a constant-temperature, constant-pressure dual-chamber cruciform burner over a wide range of the equivalence ratio (Phi = 0.7-1.4), which are used to com-pare with numerically simulated results obtained by chemkin 1-D flame speed model. Detailed reaction mechanisms of KUCRS, LLNL and JetSurF ver.02 are used for numerical simulations. It is found that exper-imental IDTs increase with the number of methyl branches, especially in low-temperature and negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regions, where the increase of IDT with the number of methyl branches are well predicted by KUCRS. We also find that the measured values of S-L of highly branched 2244mC(5) are smaller than those of n-C-9 at all values of (1) studied, of which measured S-L data are successfully repro-duced by the 1-D flame speed model with KUCRS. These results are important to our understanding of reaction characteristics for highly branched nonane isomers and for the designing of optimal alternative fuels in internal combustion engines.

In addition, a semi-empirical chemical kinetics growth model was developed which further verified that the experimentally observed decrease of acetylene and 1,3-butadiene were due to their contribution to the synthesis reaction. Using these results, we designed a mixed carbon feedstock of acetylene and 1,3-butadiene at a ratio of 2:5 which efficiently grew high purity and selectivity SWCNTs at a high growth efficiency, four-times that of pure ethylene and two-times that of pure acetylene. The combination of acetylene and 1,3-butadiene proved synergetic due to the inherent differences in reactivity and hydrogen content through \"carbon scavenging\" by the hydrogen byproducts. As a result, unlike single-source carbon feedstocks, the total carbon feedstock concentration could be increased, which resulted in increasing yields without saturating the catalysts. Our results demonstrate the complementary roles of carbon feedstocks in developing high efficiency synthesis, which is important for the advancement of the synthesis of long and clean CNTs.

                        "ja": "The effect of laser ignition on the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) was experimentally investigated. Explosive gas, which was 0.87[(1/4)C2H4 + (3/4)O-2 ] + 0.13N(2) contained in a smooth-wall tube at 100 kPa and approximately 20 degrees C, was ignited by a 1064-nm 12-ns laser at either 8 or 88.8 mm from the closed tube end connected to the gas-feeding pipe, where the incident laser energy was either 40, 80, or 120 mJ. When the gas was ignited at 8 mm from the closed tube end, although laser ignition promoted DDT, the run-up distance to DDT was shortened by approximately 10% only. This was because the DDT behavior was essentially the same as the one observed typically in ordinary spark-plug ignition, in which a flame is accelerated approximately to be a choked flame before the detonation onset. When the gas was ignited at 88.8 mm from the closed tube end, two DDT scenarios were observed. The first scenario was the typical one mentioned above. In the second scenario, the detonation onset was induced by the collision between the flame and a shock wave following the flame before the flame became the choked flame. Significant DDT promotion was realized in the second scenario by the use of laser ignition with a larger energy. The shock wave inducing the detonation onset was likely created by the end-gas autoignition near the tube end or inside the gas-feeding pipe. As a result of the analysis on the shock wave, the mixing of the unburned and burned gasses induced by the vortex generation at the flame front by the baroclinic torque (Richtmyer-Meshkov instability) is the most plausible mechanism for initiating the micro-explosions that trigger the detonation onset.

The critical flame radii and critical Peclet numbers at which cracks begin to propagate and for the onset of flame acceleration were obtained. The dependency of Pe(cl) on Ma for hydrogen-air flames was compared with that for other fuels. The results showed that cellular development depends on the intensity of the diffusional-thermal instability. The acceleration exponent and fractal excess for the acceleration regime of a hydrogen-air flame were evaluated.

In this study, this simple picture of autoignition will be presented starting from the H-2-O-2 system and then extending to practical fuel-air mixtures.
