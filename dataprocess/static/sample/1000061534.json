Seven male volunteers exercised for 10 min on a cycle ergometer at 80%(V) over dotO(2)max in heat (40 degrees C, 50% relative humidity: HT) and normal conditions (20 degrees C, 50% relative humidity: CON). Oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, ventilation, blood lactate and blood electrolytes (K(+), Na(+), Cl(-)) were measured in HT and CON. We found that ventilation was significantly higher during exercise in HT compared with CON (p &lt; 0.05) and RER tends to be higher in HT than in CON. Blood lactate was significantly higher at 3 min during exercise in HT compared with CON (5.96 +/- 0.57 mEq.l(-1) 5.00 +/- 0.28 mEq.l(-1), p &lt; 0.05). Change in strong ion difference [Delta SID = (Delta K(+) + Delta Na(+)) - (Delta Cl(-) + Delta La(-))], which affects Delta HCO(3)(-) in blood significantly, was lower at 5 min during exercise in HT compared with in CON (p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that hyperventilation during exercise in heat would induce lower HCO(3)(-) in blood and consequently would result in an increase in blood lactate at an earlier time during high-intensity exercise in heat. It was concluded that hyperventilation during short-term high-intensity exercise in heat is temporarily associated with an increase in blood lactate."

No difference in ventilatory threshold was observed between HT and CON. These results suggest that anaerobic metabolism at submaximal intensities during incremental exercise may be unchanged by HT. In contrast, exercise in HT resulted in a higher La above approximately 5mmol・l^&lt;-1&gt; and a significant difference in La was observed at 240watts compared with CON (p&lt;0.05). La at exhaustion was higher in HT compared with CON (8.5±1.4mmol・l^&lt;-1&gt; vs 6.9±1.5mmol・l^&lt;-1&gt;, p&lt;0.05) but lower peak value of La in HT during recovery was observed compared with CON (8.8±1.5mmol・l^&lt;-1&gt; vs 9.9±1.5mmol・l^&lt;-1&gt;, p&lt;0.05). In addition, La peak in HT appeared earlier during recovery than that in CON (2.3±2.7min vs 7.1±2.4min, p&lt;0.05). It is suggested from these results that higher level in La observed during incremental exercise in HT may be due to increase of La transfer from active muscle to blood."

Predicted values (VO<sub>2</sub>) were compared with measured values (VO<sub>2</sub>) obtained via a metabolic measurement system. The DP model showed a significantly higher relationship with measured VO<sub>2</sub> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95, SEE = 149 ml/min) in comparison with the HR model (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.83, SEE = 275 ml/min). The HR model showed significant systematic error (r = 0.41, <i>P</i> < .05), whereas the DP model did not (r = 0.06, <i>P</i> > .05). For comparison of prediction errors of both models, the error of the DP model (-1.3±8.8 %) was significantly smaller than the HR model (-8.0±16.5 %). The DP model also accurately estimated total energy expenditure. Therefore, the DP model is an accurate predictor of VO<sub>2</sub> during supra maximal intermittent exercise."

The purpose of this study was to determine running characteristics during the multistage 20-m shuttle run test with a triaxial accelerometer. Four male rugby players, four male long-distance runners, and three untrained males undertook two tasks: a shuttle running task (SRT), which has the same protocol as the multistage 20-m shuttle running test, and a treadmill running task (TRT), which has the same ratio of speed increase and duration time as the multistage 20-m shuttle running test. Anterior-posterior, vertical, and medial-lateral acceleration were measured using a triaxial accelerometer worn on the right side of the hip. A linear mixed model (LMM) with three factors (task, group, and velocity) was used to analyze the running characteristics in different sports. Anterior-posterior and medial-lateral outputs in the SRT were significantly higher than those in the TRT (<i>P</i>=.011; <i>P</i>=.003, respectively); by contrast, there was no significant difference in vertical output (<i>P</i>=.534). Because the interactions of task and group in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral outputs were significant, LMMs with two factors (task and velocity) in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral outputs were used in each group to analyze the effect of turn techniques. Anterior-posterior and medial-lateral outputs were increased in the SRT. Anterior-posterior output may reflect changes in the speed of turn and medial-lateral output may reflect cutting movements in the turn. Additionally, whereas both anterior-posterior and medial-lateral acceleration were increased in rugby players, only medial-lateral acceleration was increased in long-distance runners and anterior-posterior acceleration was increased in untrained males. These results indicate that data obtained using a triaxial accelerometer reflect running characteristics during the multistage 20-m shuttle run test.<br>",

Seven male subjects (age; 20.7±1.4yrs, height; 174.1±4.9cm, body mass; 68.1±4.3kg, VO_2max; 47.3±5.8 ml・kg^<-1>・min^<-1>) performed a 80%VO_2max exercise for 10 min by using cycle ergometer on two different conditions : an ambient temperature of 20℃ and 50% relative humidity (control; CON) and 40℃ and 50% relative humidity (heat trial; HT). Trials were conducted within a week in random order. Forearm skin blood flow during exercise were higher in HT compared with CON (P<0.05), however, no difference in oxygen consumption during exercise was observed between HT and CON. These results suggest that blood flow to active muscles during exercise may be unchanged by HT. In spite of the similar oxygen consumption, exercise in HT resulted in a higher La at 3 min during exercise compared with CON (6.0±0.3mmol・1^<-1> vs 5.0±0.6mmol・1^<-1>, P<0.05). In contrast, Osm was unchanged in HT during exercise and recovery compared with CON. In addition, the changes in Osm were highly correlated with the changes in total blood electrolytes (Na^+, K^+ and Cl^-) including La^- (r=0.98, P<0.05). It is suggested from these results that the changes in Osm during exercise in HT and CON may be controlled by the change in total blood electrolytes but not only the change in La^-. The reason for elevated La in HT at earlier time during exercise was unknown.",
