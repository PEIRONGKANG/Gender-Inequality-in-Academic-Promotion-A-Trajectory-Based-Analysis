                        "en": "The tumor suppressor gene maspin has been reported to inhibit the invasiveness and motility of breast cancer cells. It has been reported that maspin is expressed in normal human mammary epithelial cells but is downregulated during cancer progression, and that p53 could induce maspin expression by transcriptional activation. However, to date, the clinical significance of maspin expression and its correlation with p53 protein expression in human breast cancer patients have not been elucidated. One hundred and sixty-eight female patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, who had undergone a mastectomy (154 patients) or breast-conserving surgery (14 patients), were followed up for 15-119 months (median: 87 months) postoperatively. Immunoreactivity for maspin and p53 antibodies with paraffin-embedded carcinoma tissue was investigated using labeled streptavidin-biotin methods. Tumors with more than 20% of positive cells were considered positive for the expression of maspin. The expression of maspin in carcinoma cells was found in 27.4% (46 of 168) and significantly correlated with larger tumor size (p = 0.008), higher histologic grade (p = 0.0001) and positive p53 status (p = 0.003). A significant inverse relationship was observed between the expression of maspin and estrogen receptor (p = 0.0004) or progesterone receptor status (P = 0.02). Univariate analysis by log-rank test revealed a significant association between the expression of maspin and shorter relapse-free survival (p &lt; 0.0001) and overall survival (p &lt; 0.0001). According to Cox's multivariate analysis, the expression of maspin had the most significant effect in relapse-free survival (p &lt; 0.0001) and overall survival (p &lt; 0.0001) followed by lymph node status. In turn, the expression of maspin in 58 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ were also investigated to explore whether the downregulation of maspin through cancer progression are true or not. However, there were no positive cases in our series. These results seem to be contrary to previous reports defining maspin as a tumor suppressor gene. Although more precise characterization of the maspin expression, especially gene analysis is essential, the present investigation suggests that the expression of maspin is not downregulated through malignant progression and that the immunohistochemic detection of maspin in carcinoma cells may be helpful for selecting the group of breast cancer patients with an aggressive phenotype.

                        "en": "Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) regulates intracellular and plasma thymidine levels. TP deficiency is hypothesized to (i) increase levels of thymidine in plasma, (ii) lead to mitochondrial DNA alterations, and (iii) cause mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE). In order to elucidate the physiological roles of TP, we generated mice deficient in the TP gene. Although TP activity in the liver was inhibited in these mice, it was fully maintained in the small intestine. Murine uridine phosphorylase (UP), unlike human UP, cleaves thymidine, as well as uridine. We therefore generated TP-UP double-knockout (TP-/- UP-/-) mice. TP activities were inhibited in TP-/- UP-/- mice, and the level of thymidine in the plasma of TP-/- UP-/- mice was higher than for TP-/- mice. Unexpectedly, we could not observe alterations of mitochondrial DNA or pathological changes in the muscles of the TP-/- UP-/- mice, even when these mice were fed thymidine for 7 months. However, we did find hyperintense lesions on magnetic resonance T, maps in the brain and axonal edema by electron microscopic study of the brain in TP-/- UP-/- mice. These findings suggested that the inhibition of TP activity caused the elevation of pyrimidine levels in plasma and consequent axonal swelling in the brains of mice. Since lesions in the brain do not appear to be due to mitochondrial alterations and pathological changes in the muscle were not found, this model will provide further insights into the causes of MNGIE."

                        "en": "CyclinD1 plays a critical role in regulating cell cycle progression. CyclinD1 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in approximately 50% of primary breast cancer cases. However, its clinical significance as a predictive factor remains unclear. One hundred and seventy-three female patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma who had undergone a mastectomy (161 patients) or breast-conserving surgery (12 patients) were followed up for 6-119 months (median 86 months) postoperatively. Immunoreactivity for monoclonal anti-cyclinD1 antibody (clone DCS-6) with paraffin-embedded carcinoma tissues was investigated using a labeled streptavidin-biotin method. Overexpression of cyclinD1 was found in 42% (73 of 173), and strongly correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) expression (p &lt; 0.000001). Univariate analysis revealed no association between overexpression of cyclinD1 and overall survival or relapse-free survival in all patient groups. However, in the ER-negative subgroup (n = 75), overexpression of cyclinD1 was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival (p = 0.018) and relapse-free survival (p = 0.014) as well as the lymph node status and tumor size. In contrast, there were no significant associations between overexpression of cyclinD1 and clinical outcome in the ER-positive subgroup. According to Cox's multivariate analysis in the ER-negative subgroup, overexpression of cyclinD1 had the most significant effect on overall survival (p = 0.02) and relapse-free survival (p = 0.0058), followed by nodal status and histologic grade. These findings suggest that overexpression of cyclinD1 is an independent prognostic indicator in ER-negative breast cancer patients. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

                        "en": "A retroviral insertional mutation, especially by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), is a major cause of murine mammary tumorigenesis. Prompted by our previous finding that FGF8, an insertionally activated cellular oncogene, is highly expressed in androgen-dependent mouse mammary Shionogi carcinoma cells, we here investigated retroviral integration adjacent to the fgf8 locus in Shionogi carcinoma. In the genomic Southern blots for fgf8 and its 5'-upstream gene npm3, the hybridized fragments were identical to the host DD/Sio mice, the original Shionogi carcinoma 115 tumor, and a pair of cultured Shionogi carcinoma cell lines of SC-3 and SC-4, suggesting that no retroviral integration occurred around either loci. The genomic cloning for the fgf8 locus from SC-3 cells also confirmed no MMTV integration. In addition, npm3, which is usually coactivated with fgf8 by MMTV insertion, was not up-regulated by androgens in SC-3 cells. All these findings led us to conclude that no retroviral insertion was present at the common integration sites adjacent to the fgf8 locus in Shionogi carcinoma although we demonstrated in this study that multiple proviral sequences of MMTV, Moloney murine sarcoma virus and FBJ-murine sarcoma virus are integrated into SC-3 cells in association with their distinct promoter activity in SC-3 cells."

                        "en": "The expression of tenascin in the extrahepatic bile duct remnants in biliary atresia was investigated using an immunohistochemical method. Tenascin is thought to be a marker of repair of injured tissues based on an immunohistochemical study of a variety of tissues. Twenty-three specimens were obtained from 23 cases (2 correctable type and 21 non-correctable type) of biliary atresia at the time of the definitive operation. Positive tenascin staining was observed in matrices surrounding degenerated epithelium of the bile ductules in the obliterated extrahepatic bile duct. Regarding the correlation between the size of the bile ductule and the degree of positive staining. Furthermore, regarding the correlation between the degeneration of epithelium and the degree of staining, the bile ductules with the more significantly denuded epithelium tended to show a higher degree of positive staining. In sme specimens classified as non-correctable type, a lumen larger than 1 millimeter in diameter without epithelium was observed. This ductule itself was thought to be the original extrahepatic bile duct because strong tenascin staining was observed surrounding this lumen. These findings suggested that the extrahepatic bile duct might be obliterated after the completion of the hepatobiliary tree system and the bile ductules in the obliterated extrahepatic bile duct might be degenerated in order of their size."

                        "en": "Inbred, female Sprague-Dawley rats were neonatally androgenized at the age of 2 days by subcutaneous injections of 1.25 mg testosterone propionate and divided into 4 groups. At the age of 50 days, rats of all groups were given 20 mg 7,12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene (DMBA). Four weeks after the administration of DMBA, the rats in Group I remained intact, those in Group II were subjected to ovariectomy, while the animals in Groups III and IV were given 1 mg 17β-estradiol (E2) at 2-day intervals for 3 weeks. Additionally, the rats in Group IV were given 1 mg E2 at 2-day intervals for 3 weeks by intramuscular injection, starting from the 105th day after the administration of DMBA. The ovaries of the neonatally androgenized rats contained numerous large vesicular follicles and no corpora lutea, and the mammary glands of the animals in Groups I, III and IV consisted mainly of dilated acini containing milky secretions. In rats in Group I, mammary carcinomas and mammary dysplasias were induced. Rat mammary dysplasias were grossly characterized by gross cysts and solid masses. Solid masses were heteromorphic lesions and commonly consisted of several nodules with various microscopic features. These masses were subclassified into the 2 types of histological features that were predominant among the nodules: acinar adenosis and fibrotic adenosis. The induction of mammary carcinomas and mammary dysplasias was strongly suppressed by ovariectomy (Group II) as the development of mammary carcinomas and mammary dysplasias induced in neonatally androgenized rats are dependent on estrogens. The induction of mammary carcinomas was suppressed by injections of high doses of E2 for 21 days (Once in Group III and twice in Group IV). Conversely, the induction of mammary dysplasias was promoted by one time (Group III) but was suppressed by two times (Group IV) of E2. The results indicate that carcinoma cells and dysplasia cells induced by DMBA in neonatally androgenized rats differ in response to high doses of E2."

                        "en": "The objective of this investigation was to elucidate the role of sex hormones in the progression and subsequent hormone dependency of mammary carcinomas induced by single or multiple administration of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Ten milligrams of DMBA were administrated orally to female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats once at the age of 42 days (Group A) and three times at the ages of 28, 42 and 56 days (Group B). All 70-day-old rats in Groups A and B were divided into 4 groups (I, II, III and IV), respectively. Rats in Groups I of A and B were intact controls. Rats in Groups II of A and B were ovariectomized (OVEX) at the age of 70 days. Rats in Group II of Group A and in Groups III of Groups A and B were divided into 4 subgroups (Group II-1, II-2, II-3 and II-4) and 3 subgroups (Group III-1, III-2 and III-3), respectively. Rats in Groups II-2 of A and III-1 of A and B, rats in Groups II-3 of A and III-2 of A and B and rats in Groups II-4 of A and III-3 of A and B were given injections of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg 17β-estradiol (E2), respectively. Rats in Groups IV of A and B were given injections of 4 mg progesterone (P). Injections of E2 or P were given 3 times a week between the ages of 70 and 217 days in Group A and the ages of 70 and 105 days in Group B. In Group A, there was no difference of incidence of mammary carcinomas among Groups I, II-2, II-4, III-1 and IV but the incidence of mammary carcinomas in Groups II-1, II-3, III-2 and III-3 was extremely low, compared with that in Group I. In Group B, a large number of mammary carcinomas developed and although there was no difference in the incidence of mammary carcinomas among Groups I, II, III and IV, the number of mammary carcinomas per rat decreased in Groups II, III-2 and III-3, compared with Group I. These findings indicate that the progression of mammary carcinomas induced by a single or multiple administration of DMBA was suppressed in ovariectomized rats and in rats with injections of high doses of E2. DMBA-induced mammary carcinomas in Group B were transplanted into OVEX rats (R-1), OVEX rats with injections of 0.01 mg E2 (R-2) and OVEX rats with injections of 1 mg E2 (R-3). According to tumorigenesis in those rats with various hormonal treatments (R-1, 2, 3), mammary carcinomas were classified into one of the four categories (Type A, B, C and D). Type A tumor: tumor developed greatly in R-2 but slightly or not in R-1 and R-3. Type B tumor: tumors developed greatly in R-1 but slightly or not in R-2 and R-3. Type C tumor: tumors developed greatly in R-3 but slightly or not in R-1 and R-2. Type D tumor: tumors developed greatly in R-1, R-2 and R-3. In Group B, rates of type A, B, C, D tumor were 43.2, 13.5, 24.3 and 18.9% in Group I, 26.3, 10.5, 21.1 and 42.1% in Group II, 40.0, 5.0, 45.0 and 10.0% in Group III-1, 38.5, 15.4, 30.8 and 15.4% in Group III-2, 28.6, 0, 71.4 and 0% in Group III-3 and 44.4, 33.3, 11.1 and 11.1 in Group IV, respectively. These results suggested that the hormonal status of the development process may be one of factors which affects the characteristics of hormone dependency and the multiple administration of DMBA may induce large numbers of carcinoma cells with varying dependency on hormones and carcinoma cells may be selected in hormonal conditions during progression."

                        "en": "Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) is an enzyme involved in the reversible conversion of thymidine to thymine and is identical to an angiogenic factor, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor. TP is expressed at higher levels in a wide variety of solid tumors than in the adjacent nonneoplastic tissues. Patients with TP-positive colon and esophageal tumors have a poorer prognosis than those with TP-negative tumors. We have recently synthesized a new TP inhibitor (TPI), 5-chloro-6-[1-(2-iminopyrrolidinyl) methyl] uracil hydrochloride. We investigated the effect of TPI on angiogenesis in KB cells transfected with platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor cDNA, KB/TP, and a mock transfectant, KB/CV, using the mouse dorsal air sac assay model. We found that KB/TP cells had a higher angiogenic ability than KB/CV cells and that TPI completely suppressed angiogenesis by KB/TP, Furthermore, at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day, TPI considerably decreased the growth rate of KB/TP cells xenografted into nude mice. Microvessel density in KB/TP tumors was higher than that in KB/CV tumors, and TPI did not significantly change the density in either of the tumors. The apoptotic index in KB/TP tumors was significantly lower than that in KB/CV tumors, and TPI significantly increased the apoptotic index in KB/TP tumors but not in KB/CV tumors. These findings, taken together with previous reports, suggest that the expression of TP plays an important role in tumor growth and that TPI suppresses tumor growth by increasing the proportion of apoptotic cells and probably inhibiting angiogenesis."
