                        "en": "This study examined the mechanism governing the occurrence of defect layers of incisor dentine in Mg-deficient rats by X-ray microanalysis. Young (5 weeks of age) Wistar mate rats were pair-fed semi-synthetic diets containing either control (0.05% Mg) (N = 8) or Mg-deficient (0.001 % Mg) (N = 8) ingredients for 17 days. All animals were time marked with a combination of 0.1 mol nitrilotriacetato lead and 0.1 mol nitrilotriacetato zinc (2 mg Pb/kg body weight) on days 0, 7 and 14 into incisor dentine. Blood samples were obtained on days 10 and 17 in order to measure Ca, Mg, P and alkaline phosphatase activity levels in serum; moreover, hypomagnesaemia and hypercalcaemia were confirmed. After the 17th day, rats were sacrificed humanely under anaesthesia and mandibular incisors were removed. Dentine formation of right mandibular incisors was assessed (time marking lines); furthermore, Ca, P, Mg and sulphur (S) concentrations as well as Ca/P molar ratio were determined in left mandibular incisors based on contiguous measurement points at 2 mu m intervals from dentine pulp to dentine of the lingual aspect via X-ray analysis. Additionally, proteoglycan distribution was observed in other Mg-deficient rat dentine. These findings demonstrated decreases in body weight, incisor formation and incisor length in Mg-deficient rats. Mg and S levels increased in the defect layers, whereas proteoglycan decreased. This phenomenon was possibly attributable to condensation of Mg and S contents consequent to decreased dentine formation during Mg-deficiency and a transient increase in Mg due to transport of Mg as a result of inhibition of cell proliferation in soft tissues.

                        "en": "Gastrectomy-evoked osteopenia in the femoral metaphysis of rats can be prevented by the consumption of fructooligosaccharides (FOS). We examined the effect of FOS on the femoral neck. Twenty-eight 5-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups, sham-operated (SH) and gastrectomized (GX). One week after each operation, the rats were fed diets containing 0.5% calcium with or without 7.5% FOS for 4 weeks. After dietary treatment, the middle of the femoral neck was cross sectioned. Backscattered electron images of the sections were then taken to calculate the following morphometric parameters: (1) percent trabecular bone volume (%TBV). (2) percent cortical bone volume (%CBV), and (3) percent bone marrow cavity (%MV); all were determined relative to the entire scan area (SC). Calcium. phosphorus. and magnesium (weight percent) were then measured on, the cortical bone by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Total bone volume (%BV = %TBV + %CBV) and %CBV were almost identical among the groups, except in GX rats. In GX rats, these variables were significantly (approximately 20% and 30%. respectively; P &lt; 0.01) less than those in SH rats, whereas there were no changes in the other groups over the entire scan area. The calcium concentration close to the periosteal surface of cortical bone was markedly reduced by gastrectomy. This reduction was completely prevented by FOS consumption. These results suggest that FOS consumption prevents gastrectomy-evoked osteopenia regarding both volume and calcium concentration of the femoral neck."

                        "en": "The aim of this study was to determine the anchorage potential of the titanium mini-implant for orthodontic intrusion of the mandibular posterior teeth. Six mini-implants were surgically placed around the mandibular third premolars on each side in 3 adult male beagle dogs. On the buccal site, three mini-implants were placed distal to the apex of the distal root of the third premolar, at the interradicular septa of the third premolar, and mesial to the apex of the mesial root of the third premolar, as linearly as possible. The same procedure was performed at the lingual site on both sides of the mandibular third premolars in each dog. Bilateral interradicular mini-implants on both the buccal and the lingual sites were used as the anchorage for the intrusion of the third premolars (loaded implants) and the other mini-implants were used as control (unloaded) implants. In 6 weeks, an intrusive force (150 g) was applied between the interradicular implants on the buccal and the lingual sites by closed coil springs run across the crowns of the third premolars. After 12 to 18 weeks of orthodontic intrusion, the animals were killed and their mandibles were dissected and prepared for histologic and fluorescent observation. The results indicated that the mandibular third premolars intruded 4.5 mm, on average, after 12 to 18 weeks of orthodontic force application, with mild root resorption at the furcation area as well as the root apex. All the mini-implants remained stable during orthodontic tooth movement without any mobility or displacement. The morphometrical findings indicated that the calcification of the periimplant bone on the loaded implants was equal to or slightly greater than those of the controls. In addition, 6 of the 36 mini-implants were removed after tooth movement, and all of them were easily removed with a screwdriver. These findings suggest that mini-implants are effective tools for the anchorage of orthodontic intrusion in beagle dogs."

                        "en": "The purpose of this study was to determine the anchorage potential of titanium implants (Branemark; 3.75 x 7 mm) with the use of a sectional arch wire technique for orthodontic mesiodistal tooth movement, as assessed by the osseointegration of implants and tooth movement. Two implants were surgically placed in healed mandibular extraction sites of the second and third premolars on each side in 4 adult male beagle dogs. The implants were surgically uncovered 18 weeks later, and second-stage abutments with soldered edgewise tubes were attached. Segmented edgewise rectangular archwires (0.017 x 0.025 inch) with a T-loop or an L-loop were placed between the implants and the fourth premolars on both sides as the anchorage unit. One segment in each dog served as a loaded side, and the archwire was calibrated to produce 200 g of lateral force on the fourth premolar, The contralateral segment served as an unloaded side and was not subjected to orthodontic force. Sectional wires were activated biweekly 24, 28, 28, and 32 weeks, respectively, depending on the magnitude and the appearance of mesial tipping movement of the fourth premolar. After mandibular impressions were taken to measure the distance between the first molar and the fourth premolar, the animals were euthanized and dissected mandibles were prepared. The specimens were then embedded in polyester resin and cut to take backscattered electron images. On the basis of these images, the percentage of peri-implant bone volume was calculated and defined as an index of osseointegration. The differences between the initial and final fourth premolar to first molar distances varied (7.40, 8.85, 10.50, and 3.30 mm) on the loaded side, whereas the unloaded side showed no movement. Not only was there no statistical difference in the percent of peri-implant bone volume between the loaded and unloaded sides, but there was also no statistical difference between the compression and tension sides in both loaded and unloaded implants, which suggests that the implants maintained rigid osseointegration. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that endosseous titanium implants can function as anchors for long-term orthodontic mesiodistal movement."

                        "en": "Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) have been shown to stimulate apparent calcium absorption in the intestine. In this study, we examined the effect of FOS on true calcium absorption using the calcium balance in combination with the Ca-45 kinetics method. Sixteen 45-d-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups, a control group (n = 8) and a FOS group (n = 8). The diet fed to the FOS group contained 5% FOS, at the expense of half of the sucrose in the control diet. After an adaptation period (3 d) and a free-access period (3 cf) that were used to estimate the amount of food required for pair-feeding on the basis of calcium, all of the rats were pair-fed throughout the experiment from the age of 51 d. A constant amount of calcium was fed to the rats in each group (95 mg/d). At age 60 d, a 3-d metabolic study was started by the intravenous injection of Ca-45. Several variables were calculated on the bases of measurements of calcium intake, calcium in feces and serum, and 45Ca in feces, urine and serum. Both true and apparent calcium absorption in the intestine (Vad and Vna) and urinary calcium were significantly greater in rats that had been fed FOS. There were no differences between the groups in endogenous net calcium excretion into feces (Vf; Vad - Vna). The calcium balance was also enhanced by FOS. Calcium balance in the FOS group was significantly correlated with the absorbed calcium (r(2) = 0.936, P &lt; 0.01), as was that in the control group (r(2) = 0.994, P &lt; 0.01). These results suggest that the increased true calcium absorption and balance produced by FOS feeding might improve bone calcification."
