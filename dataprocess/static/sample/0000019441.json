                        "en": "The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is involved in many electrical–chemical energy conversion systems; however, the slow reaction rate of the OER leads to a high overpotential (η) and low energy efficiency. Recently, an extremely low-η OER phenomenon was observed at a carbonaceous Fe–N-doped thin film with enriched step edges on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and the carbon fiber surface in an alkaline electrolyte, although the activity was limited. In this study, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were used as substrates to utilize their high specific surface areas to develop an active OER catalyst. Nanoscale etching of the MWCNT surface was performed by Fe3O4 nanoparticle loading and subsequent heat treatment in an inert atmosphere, followed by acid washing. Afterwards, a carbonaceous thin film containing Fe and N was coated on the surface via sublimation, deposition, and pyrolysis of Fe phthalocyanine (Pc). A roughened surface was observed for the FePc-derived thin film coated on the nano-etched MWCNT, in contrast to the smooth surface observed for the film coated on the MWCNT without nano-etching. The combination of the nano-etching and the thin-film coating enhanced the OER, which was analyzed by parallel Tafel processes."

The resistance and capacitance components of the electrode can be evaluated by applying an AC voltage and changing the frequency. In particular, analysis using the equivalent circuit can determine important parameters related to the electrochemical reaction of the electrode, such as the charge transfer resistance, electric double-layer capacitance, and Warburg impedance. Moreover, the internal resistance of the cell can be divided into resistances caused by the positive electrode, negative electrode, and electrolyte. Because of these advantages, EIS is a powerful technique used for basic research, such as in identifying the rate-determining step of an electrochemical reaction, and also for applied research, such as characterizing electrochemical devices (e.g., batteries and capacitors). In this paper, the concept of impedance, which represents the relationship between the AC voltage and current, is first explained; then, the AC characteristics of various circuit elements used in equivalent circuits, which are essential for understanding EIS, are described. Finally, treatments of more complex circuits based on transmission-line models (TLMs), which are used to represent equivalent circuits of porous electrodes, are presented. Analyses based on TLMs are the foundation for understanding electrodes for practical applications because porous electrodes are usually used in electrochemical devices."

                        "en": "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is widely used for the analysis of various electrochemical devices, as it can quantitatively evaluate the main kinetic parameters related to electrochemical phenomena by analysis using equivalent circuits. This paper describes practical applications of EIS, along with EIS measurement and analysis methods for solid electrolytes, Li-ion batteries (LIBs), and electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). In all applications, it is necessary to properly measure the impedance data for an adequate equivalent circuit analysis. Therefore, after presenting the backgrounds of EIS applications in the Section 1 (Introduction), the experimental cautions in the measurements are discussed in detail in Sections 2– 4. Section 2 (“EIS for Solid Electrolytes”) presents practical examples of measurements for accurate data, as the EIS analysis of solid electrolytes requires impedance data in the high-frequency range above 1 MHz. Section 3 (“EIS for Lithium-Ion Batteries”) describes a method of separating the internal resistance into the resistances of the positive and negative electrodes and electrolyte resistance, as the output power capabilities of LIBs are frequently evaluated based on an internal resistance. In particular, a symmetrical cell technique enabling measurements of the impedance data only for the positive or negative electrode is demonstrated. As described in Section 4 (“EIS for Electric Double-Layer Capacitors”), the excessive and unwanted impedances arising from instruments and cells must be suppressed as much as possible for appropriately measuring the correct EIS of EDLCs, because the resistance of EDLCs is very small. Therefore, the experimental setup that should be considered in EIS measurements for EDLCs leading to disturbed impedance data is discussed, along with the effects of this scenario on the impedance data. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section 5 (Summary)."

Rh complexes on carbon black exhibit much higher CO oxidation activity than Rh porphyrins or conventional Pt alloy catalysts. The onset potential for CO oxidation is lower than 0 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode. As a result, a combination of electrochemical CO oxidation by Rh tetraaza[14]annulene and proton reduction by Pt catalysts generates slight electricity. The combined overall reaction is a water-gas shift reaction (CO+H2O→CO2+H2). The co-presence of Rh tetraaza[14]annulene catalyst and Pt catalyst promotes the water-gas shift reaction."

                        "en": "Although the mechanism of lithium dendritic growth is still under discussion, several researchers have reported that insufficient mass transfer causes dendrite formation. Recently, the synthesis of a single lithium molten salt, lithium (fluorosulfonyl)( trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (Li[FTA], m.p. 100°C), was reported, which can be used with a lithium electrode (m.p. 180°C). In this study, we focused on lithium electrodeposition from Li[FTA], where the lithium-ion concentration is constant at any time and location, even during electrodeposition, such that the mass transfer is always sufficient. Consequently, the formation of needle-like dendrites was suppressed using this single lithium molten salt. Thus, results imply that using a molten salt, such as Li[FTA], is a potential solution for the dendrite problem."

The overpotentials for the oxidation are lower than those with other conventional Co phthalocyanine-based catalysts. This electrocatalytic oxidation is coupled with the redox potential of Rh phthalocyanine. The introduction of an electron-donating group causes negative shift in the redox potential, and decreases the onset potential for the oxidation of glucose. The Rh phthalocyanine catalyst needs activation before the catalytic oxidation of glucose. This activation is achieved by the exposure of the catalyst to negative potentials. This catalyst also oxidizes gluconate, which is a possible 2-electron oxidation product of glucose. Electrolysis of glucose solution shows that glucose undergoes multi-electron (more than 2) oxidation by the Rh phthalocyanine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Carbon-supported Rh porphyrins catalyze the oxidation of carbon monoxide by water-soluble electron acceptors. The rate of this reaction is plotted as a function of the redox potential of the electron acceptor. The rate increases with an increase in the redox potential until it reaches a plateau. This profile can be explained in terms of the electrocatalytic CO oxidation activity of the Rh porphyrin. The removal of CO from CO(2%)/H-2 by a solution containing a carbon-supported Rh porphyrin and an electron acceptor is examined. The complete conversion of CO to CO2 is achieved with only a slight amount of Rh porphyrins. Rh porphyrin on carbon black gives higher conversion than that dissolved in solution. This reaction can be used not only to remove CO in anode gas of stationary polymer electrolyte fuel cells but also to regenerate a reductant in indirect CO fuel cell systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

                        "en": "The ionic and electronic effective conductivities of an electrode mixture layers for all-solid-state lithium ion batteries containing Li2S-P2S5 as a solid electrolyte were investigated by AC impedance measurements and analysis using a transmission-line model (TLM). Samples containing graphite (graphite electrodes) or LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM electrodes) as the active material were measured under a \"substrate vertical bar sample vertical bar bulk electrolyte vertical bar sample vertical bar substrate\" configuration (ion-electron connection) and a \"substrate vertical bar sample vertical bar substrate\" configuration (electron-electron connection). Theoretically, if the electronic resistance is negligibly small, which is the case with our graphite electrodes, measurement with the ion-electron connection should be effective for evaluating ionic conductivity. However, if the electronic resistance is comparable to the ionic resistance, which is the case with our NCM electrodes, the results with the ion-electron connection may contain some inherent inaccuracy. In this report, we theoretically and practically demonstrate the advantage of analyzing the results with the electron electron connection, which gives both the ionic and electronic conductivities. The similarity of the behavior of ionic conductivity with the graphite and NCM electrodes confirms the reliability of this analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Composite electrodes containing active materials, carbon and binder are widely used in lithium-ion batteries. Since the electrode reaction occurs preferentially in regions with lower resistance, reaction distribution can be happened within composite electrodes. We investigate the relationship between the reaction distribution with depth direction and electronic/ionic conductivity in composite electrodes with changing electrode porosities. Two dimensional X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the reaction distribution is happened in lower porosity electrodes. Our developed 6-probe method can measure electronic/ionic conductivity in composite electrodes. The ionic conductivity is decreased for lower porosity electrodes, which governs the reaction distribution of composite electrodes and their performances."

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities of the Fe-Pc/perovskite/C catalysts were investigated in alkaline media using rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) method. Although all of the Fe-Pc/perovskite/C catalysts showed enhanced ORR activities with a positive shift of the onset potential compared to perovskite/C and Fe-Pc/C, the number of electrons during ORR was different due to the HO2- reduction activity of the perovskite/C. Among the prepared catalysts, the Fe-Pc/La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.7Co0.3O3/C catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity, which was comparable to that of the Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, oxygen reduction on this catalyst proceeds thorough an efficient 2 + 2 pathway with the formation of only a very small fraction of HO2- (0.5-3%). (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

The Co-OEP/La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.6Fe0.4O3/C catalyst showed improved ORR activity, with a positive shift of the onset potential. In addition, a decreased ring current compared to Co-OEP/C suggested that the quasi-four-electron reduction of 02 was also enhanced. Further experiments showed that ORR activity was also enhanced by Co-OEP-modification of other types of carbon (Ketjen-black EC600JD, Denka Black) or perovskite-type oxide (La0.6Ca0.4Mn0.6Fe0.4O3, La0.8Sr0.2Co0.6Fe0.4O3). In the case of the addition of other porphyrin complexes (cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (Co-TPP), iron octaethylporphyrin (Fe-OEP)) to a La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.6Fe0.4O3/C catalyst, the onset potential did not shift to the positive side due to the lower activity compared to Co-OEP.

In the examined models, ionic resistance in pores, faradaic impedance, and electronic resistance are considered. Numerical calculation of the impedance values of each model revealed the effects of each parameters on the behaviors of the Cole-Cole plots. In addition, effects of additional elements set at the both ends of the transmission-line model, which determine the boundary conditions, were also examined. Finally, possibility to extract the impedance at the interface only by reverse-estimation was investigated. Although this attempt has been achieved, it is also demonstrated that inaccuracies of the assumed parameters might deteriorate the estimated values.

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)-energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping clearly revealed that the oxide prepared by the PVP method was small (ca. 20 nm) and highly dispersed on the carbon support. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity on the perovskite/C catalyst was investigated with rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurement in an alkaline solution at 25 degrees C. The prepared perovskite/C catalyst showed enhanced activity compared to catalysts obtained by the conventional solid state reaction and citrate process; i.e., a positive shift of the onset potential and increased ORR current at a disk electrode. The present catalyst was also associated with decreased ring current."

First, three types of connection (Z-type, T-type, and E-type) were considered. A more generalized connection that includes the characteristics of both Z-type and T-type (universal-type) was also considered. All four of the resulting general solutions were versatile, but quite complicated. Next, comprehensive variations of the general solutions depending on specific boundary conditions, which are generally simpler, were also considered. Finally, an equivalent transform from a three-terminal TML model to a simple Y-circuit was calculated. This enables calculation of the serial connection of multiple TML models with different parameters, which represents a multi-layered electrode. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Platinum dissolution and redeposition, carbon-support corrosion, inhomogeneity during start-up and cell reversal are discussed as factors that influence the degradation of electrocatalysts with relation to electrode potential. Early research findings at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, are mainly used as a basis of discussion. The development of highly durable electrocatalysts using an oxide support based on the results of degradation studies to suppress electrocatalyst degradation is summarized with a main focus on Pt-deposited Ti4O7 catalysts developed at AIST. The development of high-CO-concentration durable anode electrocatalysts is also reviewed. In particular, an electrocatalyst that uses an organic complex as a co-electrocatalyst with a platinum ruthenium alloy anode electrocatalyst developed at AIST is included as a novel high-CO-concentration durable anode electrocatalyst."

                        "en": "A new easy-to-use process for obtaining fine powders of lanthanum-based perovskite-type oxides (La1-xAexMO3: Ae=Ca, Sr, M=Mn, Co, Fe) with a high specific surface area was successfully developed by the use of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as a dispersant. This approach made it possible to prepare a single phase of perovskite by calcining at a lower temperature (600°C) compared to conventional synthetic processes such as a solid state reaction and citrate process. SEM observations revealed that the oxide prepared with PVP was ca. 20-30nm in size, while those prepared by the citrate process and solid state reaction were ca. 50nm and 1μm, respectively. Furthermore, the results of a thermal analysis in which we heated the precursors for the different reactions support the idea that PVP plays an important role in the formation of the perovskite phase at low temperature."
