                        "en": "The purpose of this study was to compare the cardiovascular responses to different types of mental stress. Ten healthy males performed a mental arithmetic task (MA) on one day and were exposed to white noise (WN, 80dB) on another day. Both the MA and the WN were composed of four 5-min consecutive periods with a 3-min rest between them. On each day, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were measured continually during the entire experimental period. The changes from the baseline (Δ) in all periods were calculated for both mental stresses. As for the results, the δMAP, δCO, δHR, and δTPR in the MA did not significantly change during the task periods. However, in the WN, the δMAP and δTPR showed significant increases over the time of the consecutive periods. In addition, we discuss the response patterns for the two mental stresses. We examine three hemodynamic reactivity patterns: a cardiac pattern characterized by increased CO and decreased TPR, a mixed pattern characterized by a moderate increase in both CO and TPR, and a vascular pattern characterized by increased TPR and decreased CO. The results show that throughout all task/exposure periods, the response pattern remained the same for six subjects in each stress. Furthermore, of these six subjects, half showed the same response pattern in both the MA and the WN. In conclusion, compared to the MA task, consecutive WN exposure showed an accumulation of stress responses. A change in TPR contributed to a gradual increase in MAP in the WN. It is also possible that among the subjects there were different types of response to the MA and WN."

In the present study, we attempted to clarify whether or not an EGG can be used to evaluate the influence of illumination, and what kinds of effect taste stimuli and illumination have on the autonomic nervous system. In this study, we used the ratio of the normal wave component of the EGG (EGG-NR: 2-4.5 cpm power/1-10 cpm power) and the amplitude of a normal wave (EGG-M: integrated EGG of 2-4.5 cpm). Thirteen healthy males participated in 16 experimental conditions (4 lighting conditions×4 taste stimuli). The four lighting conditions were set by combinations of illuminance levels of 200 and 1500 lx and color temperatures of 3000 and 7500 K. The four taste stimuli were sweet (glucose), salty (salt), sour (acetic acid), and bitter (quinine). The changes in EGG-NR and EGG-NI were compared for different taste conditions. The results showed that EGG-NI was not significantly affected by the different taste conditions. However, the main effect of taste on EGG-NR was significant: sweet and salty tastes were significantly higher than the bitter taste. EGG-NR and EGG-NI in different lighting conditions were also compared. The main effect of different color temperatures was also significant, but the illuminance level did not affect EGG-NR. EGG-NR increased significantly at the lower color temperature. On the other hand, EGG-NI significantly increased at the lower illuminance. These results suggest that parasympathetic nervous activity has a predominant effect on gastric activity in different lighting environments. Therefore, EGG measurements may be useful indicators for illumination environment studies."

                        "en": "We examined the effects of monochromatic light on the time sense and the central nervous system. Nine young adult volunteers participated in this study. They were exposed to red-light and blue-light environments (illuminance was kept at 3101x). We evaluated the time sense by time-production tests of 90s and 180s and measured the P300 event-related potentials during an auditory oddball task. The 90-s time intervals produced by subjects in the two monochromatic light conditions were not significantly different. However, the 180-s time interval produced in the red-light condition (163.2±50.4s) was significantly (p&lt\n0.05) shorter than that in the blue-light condition (199.0±54.4s). The peak latency of P300 in the red light (322.2±26.6ms) was found to be significantly (p&lt\n0.05) shorter also than that in the blue light (332.6±20.2ms). The feelings measured by the visual analogue scales in the two light conditions were not significantly different. These results indicate that the time sense ran faster in the red-light than in the blue-light condition. We suggest that the higher activity in the central nervous system that is accounted for by the shorter latency of P300 is related to the acceleration of the time sense."

                        "en": "This study was intended to determine the effects of continuous bright light exposure on cardiovascular responses, particularly heart rate variability (HRV), at rest and during performance of mental tasks with acute nocturnal sleep deprivation. Eight healthy male subjects stayed awake from 21.00 to 04.30 hours under bright (BL, 2800 lux) or dim (DL, 120 lux) light conditions. During sleep deprivation, mental tasks (Stroop color-word conflict test: CWT) were performed for 15 min each hour. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiratory rate, urinary melatonin concentrations and rectal temperature were measured. During sleep deprivation, BL exposure depressed melatonin secretion in comparison to DL conditions. During sleep deprivation, exposure to BL delayed the decline in heart rate (HR) for 4h in resting periods. A significant increment of HR induced by each CWT was detected, especially at 03.00 h and later, under DL conditions only. In addition, at 04.00 h, an index of sympathetic activity and sympatho-vagal balance on HRV during CWT increased significantly under DL conditions. Li contrast, an index of parasympathetic activity during CWT decreased significantly under DL conditions. However, the indexes of HRV during CWT did not change throughout sleep deprivation under BL conditions. Our results suggest that BL exposure not only delays the nocturnal decrease in HR at rest but also maintains HR and balance of cardiac autonomic modulation to mental tasks dnring nocturnal sleep deprivation."

We used the difference in warning presentation rate as a way of measuring the influence on performance. The performance was the worst and the sympathetic nerve activity was highest in the 50% warning presentation rate condition, and the performance was better for where warning was not presented (0%) or at all of the presentation without fail (100%), and the relation between the warning presentation rate and the task performance showed the tendency to a reverse-u-shaped.

Nine elderly people and eleven young students participated in this study. A subject stepped toward the lateral direction on a force plate. We measured CFP deflection characteristics of the subjects in the two groups. We measured muscular strength from the trunk to the foot using a hand-held dynamometer. We compared the CFP deflection characteristics between the two age groups. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between the muscular strength and CFP deflection characteristics in the single stance phase, which recognized a pathognomonic difference between the two groups. As compared with the young group, the elderly group showed significantly low values of deflection speed and standard deviation of deflection speed. It was suggested that the antigravity muscle extending from the planta pedis to the trunk contributed to the control of CFP deflection speed in the elderly group. Furthermore, it was suggested that the unsteadiness in the elderly was a result of a decrease in the CFP control ability due to the depression of the feedback mechanism of the sensory system with aging.",

                        "en": "In order to study the cognitive function rhythm related to the auditory frequency system for people who prefer to be active in the morning and at night, we conducted an experiment during morning (09:00), evening (17:00) and late-night (01:00) periods. On the basis of a morningness/eveningness questionnaire, six moderately morning-type subjects (M-types) and seven evening-type subjects (E-types) were selected. Diurnal variation of event-related potential (ERP) were assessed under low-frequency (250/500 Hz) and high-frequency (1000/2000 Hz) condition using an oddball task. M-types were tested during the morning (09:00) and evening (17:00) periods, and E-types were tested during the evening (17:00) and midnight (01:00) periods. Subjects were asked to press a button when the target stimulus was detected. We found that the P300 amplitude at 09:00 was significantly greater than that at 17:00 for M-types, was significantly greater at 17:00 than that at 01:00 for E-types. A significant difference of P300 latency and P300 amplitude was observed at 17:00 between M-types and E-types. The P300 amplitude obtained after a low-frequency stimulus was significantly greater than that after a high-frequency stimulus at 09:00 for M-types, and at 01:00 for E-types. These results revealed that stimulus frequency had effects on the diurnal changes of human cognitive function, and circadian typology had a direct effect on the diurnal change of human cognitive function. This study has extended the previous findings of auditory P300 studies on diurnal variations in terms of circadian typology and stimulus parameter."

Especially, cultural adaptation and flowing stresses by itself is the most important viewpoint of human adaptability in the recent modern life. In this paper, the authors reviewed the keywords of physiological anthropology, especially with the focus on techno-adaptability, and presented our experimental trials to study physiological polymorphism of cardio-vascular reactivity to mental stresses. We scoped the psychological stresses by means of mental tasks as an experimental model of techno-stress. Techno-stress was defined as not only from inadequate interface of man-machine system, but also from increased social complexity owing to highly advanced technological social system. In the experimental trial, we observed different types of cardio-vascular responses to several mental tasks. Blood pressure rose significantly during the tasks. However, contribution of change in cardiac output and total peripheral resistance on it was not the same between subgroups of the subjects."

                        "en": "This article presents our recent studies on the effects of color temperature on the taste sense and the influence of color temperature on bright light exposure during night rest period. Ten male Japanese and ten male Chinese were exposed to four illumination conditions (200, 1500 lx X 3000, 7500 K). Their taste threshold of four common tastes and amount of saliva were measured. It was found in both Japanese and Chinese subjects that sensitivities to sweet and bitter taste were decreased under the lower illuminance condition. Under the lower color temperature condition, sensitivity to bitter taste in Japanese and sweet taste in Chinese were decreased. Secretion of saliva increased under the lower illuminance condition in both Japanese and Chinese. Only in Chinese subjects, secretion of saliva increased under the lower color temperature condition. In a separate experiment, six male Japanese students were subjected to bright light exposure during a night rest period. They performed a mental task from 23:00 h till 02:00 h, and took a rest from 00:00 h to 01:00 h. During the rest period they were exposed to bright light (3000 lx) of three different color temperatures: 3000 K, 5000 K, and 7000 K. After exposure to bright light of 3000 K but not at other color temperatures, the EEG α1 band ratio and the β band ratio at 02:00 h were higher and lower, respectively, than that at 01:00 h. These findings indicated that lower color temperature bright light exposure during a night rest break led to a reduction of subjects' arousal level during the subsequent work. Herein, we discuss these results from the viewpoint of physiological anthropology."

We conducted the experiment for 16-conditions (4 lighting conditions×4 taste solutions). The four lighting conditions were 200 and 1500 lx in illuminance and by 3000 and 7500K in color temperature. The four taste solutions were sweet (glucose), salty (salt), sour (acetic acid), and bitter (quinine). The subjects were healthy seven Japanese and six Chinese males. The changes of EGG normal wave ratio (EGG-NR; 2〜4.5 cpm power/1〜10 cpm power) after stimulation were compared among taste conditions. As a result, the main effect of taste was significant. EGG-NR of the sweet and the salty taste were higher than the bitter taste. Then separate analyses were conducted for Japanese and Chinese. EGG-NR for the sweet taste and the salty taste were higher than the bitter one in Japanese, but there were no difference in Chinese. We also compared EGG-NR in different lighting conditions, the main effect of color temperature was significant, but not in the illuminance. EGG-NR increased significantly in the lower color temperature.",

Electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), brain haemodynamics, and blood pressure (BP) were measured during a visual search task accompanied with short-term memory. When the difficulty of task became greater, the larger changes in beta-1 power ratio of EEG and diastolic BP were observed. Along with work execution, parasympathetic nervous activity decreased. Furthermore, beta-1 power ratio and increase in diastolic BP showed a significant correlation. In conclusion, this study suggests that beta-1 power ratio of EEG and diastolic BP are useful in the evaluation of mental workload as the degree of difficulty, and HRV might be effective to evaluate a time change of a mental workload with accomplishment of the task.",

In this research, it aimed to clarify that the influence of malfunction of a warning sound (a lack and a false of alarm) on a performance of a compound cognitive task (a stick control task and a 2 back task). Reaction times of stick control task and 2 back task and correct answer rate of 2 back task were analyzed as performance indices. Reaction time of stick control task was significantly longer in a false of alarm than in a lack of alarm. Although reaction time of 2 back task showed no significant differences between a false and a lack of alarm, a correct answer rate was significantly lower in a false of alarm than in a lack of alarm. The correct answer rate was the lowest immediately after the onset of malfunction operation. In the case of a false of alarm, the timing of a false alarm sounds was not able to expect, and the alarm sound becomes an interference sound and causes the performance to be decreased."

In addition, posture control in the elderly will also be reviewed. The study included 17 healthy elderly subjects and 14 students, adding up to a total of 31 subjects. The subject positioned himself on the force plate and performed an abnormal movement that resulted in a maximum shift of the center of gravity toward the right of the force plate. When the working CFP, acromion, and anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) moved anteriorly, the deflection (Y-SD) was measured along with the muscle force of lower limb (% body weight). A correlation was sought between each of the above parameters. The results indicated a significant negative correlation between CFP Y-SD and muscle force required for trunk deflection in the elderly group (r=-0.51, p<0.05). In addition, a significant positive correlation was recognized between each of CFP Y-SD, acromion Y-SD, and ASIS Y-SD in the young group (r=0.75, 0.69, p<0.01). Based on the results of the elderly group, it was considered that the muscle force of the tibialis posterior muscle which contributes to the drop of metatarsus and forefoot, and anteroposterior homeostasis contributed to the control of the CFP deflection in the elderly. Thus, it is considered that the factors controlling CFP deflection that occurs during a lateral shift of the center of gravity in the elderly are different from those in the young. The results also suggest different mechanism for maintenance of posture in the two groups.",
