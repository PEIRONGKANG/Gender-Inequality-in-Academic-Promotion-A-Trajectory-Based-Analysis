                        "en": "Northwest Africa (NWA) 6704 is a unique achondrite characterized by a near-chondritic major element composition with a remarkably intact igneous texture. To investigate the origin of this unique achondrite, we have conducted a combined petrologic, chemical, and 187Re–187Os, O, and Ti isotopic study. The meteorite consists of orthopyroxene megacrysts (En55–57Wo3–4Fs40–42\n Fe/Mn = 1.4) up to 1.7 cm in length with finer interstices of olivine (Fa50–53\n Fe/Mn = 1.1–2.1), chromite (Cr# ∼ 0.94), awaruite, sulfides, plagioclase (Ab92An5Or3) and merrillite. The results of morphology, lattice orientation analysis, and mineral chemistry indicate that orthopyroxene megacrysts were originally hollow dendrites that most likely crystallized under high super-saturation and super-cooling conditions (1–102 °C/h), whereas the other phases crystallized between branches of the dendrites in the order of awaruite, chromite → olivine → merrillite → plagioclase. In spite of the inferred high super-saturation, the remarkably large size of orthopyroxene can be explained as a result of crystallization from a melt containing a limited number of nuclei that are preserved as orthopyroxene megacryst cores having high Mg# or including vermicular olivine. The Re–Os isotope data for bulk and metal fractions yield an isochron age of 4576 ± 250 Ma, consistent with only limited open system behavior of highly siderophile elements (HSE) since formation. The bulk chemical composition is characterized by broadly chondritic absolute abundances and only weakly fractionated chondrite-normalized patterns for HSE and rare earth elements (REE), together with substantial depletion of highly volatile elements relative to chondrites. The HSE and REE characteristics indicate that the parental melt and its protolith had not undergone significant segregation of metals, sulfides, or silicate minerals. These combined results suggest that a chondritic precursor to NWA 6704 was heated well above its liquidus temperature so that highly volatile elements were lost and the generated melt initially contained few nuclei of relict orthopyroxene, but the melting and subsequent crystallization took place on a timescale too short to allow magmatic differentiation. Such rapid melting and crystallization might occur as a result of impact on an undifferentiated asteroid. The O–Ti isotope systematics (Δ17O = −1.052 ± 0.004, 2 SD\n ε50Ti = 2.28 ± 0.23, 2 SD) indicate that the NWA 6704 parent body sampled the same isotopic reservoirs in the solar nebula as the carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies. This is consistent with carbonaceous chondrite-like refractory element abundances and oxygen fugacity (FMQ = −2.6) in NWA 6704. Yet, the Si/Mg ratio of NWA 6704 is remarkably higher than those of carbonaceous chondrites, suggesting significant nebular fractionation of forsterite in its provenance."

                        "en": "Dunite bands and dikes in ophiolitic mantle peridotites are interpreted as fossil melt channels within the suboceanic mantle. Concordant dunite bands (i.e. fossil melt channels transposed by outward transportation from the ridge axis via horizontal mantle flow) are particularly important as they possibly represent the melt channels through which the parental melts of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) were transported to shallower depths beneath the paleo-ridge axis. We conducted field observations and sampling of concordant dunite bands (CDB) and their host harzburgite at selected outcrops covering a wide depth range in the mantle section along an inferred paleo-ridge segment in the northern to central part of the Oman ophiolite. The CDB increase in thickness and decrease in frequency upward. They are thicker and more frequent in the centre of the segment than near the segment ends when compared at the same stratigraphic level. The CDB consist mostly of olivine with minor spinel and very rare amounts of pyroxene. Clinopyroxene has a small grain size and an interstitial position relative to olivine. The constituent minerals in the CDB and their host harzburgite were analyzed by electron microprobe for major elements and by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for trace elements. Most of the CDB have refractory major element mineral compositions, such as high Fo [100 x Mg/(Mg + Fe)] in olivine (&gt; 90 center dot 5), high Cr# [Cr/(Cr + Al)] in chromian spinel (&gt; 0 center dot 50), and low Al2O3 (&lt; 3 center dot 5 wt %) in clinopyroxene. Chondrite-normalized trace element patterns of clinopyroxene in the host harzburgites consistently show a gentle decrease from heavy REE (HREE) to middle REE (MREE) and a sharp decrease from MREE to light REE (LREE) (= highly depleted), but those in the CDB show weaker LREE depletion, which is more variable depending on the stratigraphic level and position along the paleo-ridge segment. In contrast, the HREE concentrations in clinopyroxene in the CDB are higher than or similar to those of the host harzburgites. Trace element compositions of clinopyroxene in the CDB and their host harzburgites are evaluated with a one-dimensional, steady-state, open-system decompressional melting-reaction model. The modeling results suggest that an LREE-enriched melt generated at high pressure was transported upwards through melt channels to the shallow mantle (up to the Moho transition zone), where it mingled with highly depleted melts accumulated from fractionally melted peridotites to generate normal (N)-MORB-like melts. The mantle started upwelling (= melting) in the garnet stability field in the segment centre, but either in the garnet or in the spinel stability field near the segment ends. This suggests a variation of geothermal gradient along the paleo-ridge segment: higher in the segment centre and lower near the segment ends. This inference is supported by the presence of thicker (up to 250 cm) CDB as well as more frequent occurrence of CDB in the segment centre than near the segment end and by the geochemical evidence for chromatographic N-MORB-like melt percolation into the host peridotite only in the uppermost horizons near the segment ends."

                        "en": "The South Kitakami Massif is one of the oldest geological domains in Japan having Silurian strata with acidic pyroclastic rocks and Ordovician-Silurian granodiorite-tonalite basement, suggesting that it was matured enough to develop acidic volcanisms in the Silurian period. On the northern and western margin of the South Kitakami Massif, an Ordovician arc ophiolite (Hayachine-Miyamori Ophiolite) and high-pressure and low-temperature metamorphic rocks (Motai metamorphic rocks) exhumed sometime in the Ordovician-Devonian periods are distributed. Chronological, geological, and petrochemical studies on the Hayachine-Miyamori Ophiolite, Motai metamorphic rocks, and other early Paleozoic geological units of the South Kitakami Massif are reviewed for reconstruction of the South Kitakami arc system during Ordovician to Devonian times with supplementary new data. The reconstruction suggests a change in the convergence polarity from eastward- to westward-dipping subduction sometime before the Late Devonian period. The Hayachine-Miyamori Ophiolite was developed above the eastward-dipping subduction through three distinctive stages. Two separate stages of overriding plate extension inducing decompressional melting with minor involvement of slab-derived fluid occurred before and after a stage of melting under strong influence of slab-derived fluids. The first overriding plate extension took place in the back-arc side forming a back-arc basin. The second one took place immediately before the ophiolite exhumation and near the fore-arc region. We postulate that the second decompressional melting was triggered by slab breakoff, which was preceded by slab rollback inducing trench-parallel wedge mantle flow and non-steady fluid and heat transport leaving exceptionally hydrous residual mantle. The formation history of the Hayachine-Miyamori Ophiolite implies that weaker plate coupling may provide preferential conditions for exhumation of very hydrous mantle. Very hydrous peridotites involved in arc magmatism have not yet been discovered except for in the Cambrian-Ordovician periods, suggesting its implications for global geodynamics, such as the thermal state and water circulation in the mantle."

Crystalline dust has morphologies reflecting the anisotropic crystal structure and formation conditions or processes. and may emit characteristic infrared features. In this study, evaporation and condensation experiments of corundum along different crystallographic orientations were performed in vacuum to determine key kinetic parameters controlling morphological anisotropy: evaporation and condensation coefficients (alpha(e) and alpha(c)), the degrees of kinetic hindrance on evaporation and condensation. Plausible shapes of corundum condensates were estimated from the experimental results to evaluate the infrared features of corundum condensates. The evaporation coefficients of corundum are 0.02-0.2 at 1600-1785 degrees C, which increase with temperature and show notable anisotropy. The order of ae along the crystallographic c, a, and m. axes is alpha(m)(e) &gt;&gt; alpha(e) (a) &gt; alpha(c)(e) irrespective of temperature. The obtained condensation coefficients along the c, a, and m. axes at 1575 degrees C and a supersaturation ratio of similar to 4 are 0.04-0.06, 0.06-0.08, and 0.1-0.2, respectively. The morphology of condensed circumstellar corundum expected from our experiments is oblate and slightly flattened to the c. axis. and is consistent with the fact that no presolar corundum with eccentric shapes has been found. The mass absorption coefficient of oblate corundum slightly flattened to the c. axis shows a peak at 13 mu m without any accompanying strong peaks. These results strongly indicate that corundum condensed anisotropically in circumstellar environments is a carrier of the unidentified 13 mu m feature around oxygen-rich evolved stars."

                        "en": "Intra-plate Cenozoic volcanism in Kita-Matsuura, northwestern Kyushu, Japan, shows systematic spatio-temporal changes in geochemistry that can be explained by partial melting followed by melt segregation in a region of upwelling mantle. We have examined the thermal and melting history of the upwelling mantle by quantitatively estimating melt water contents and melting conditions. The water content of a spectrum of primary melts is estimated to range from 0 center dot 5 to 1 center dot 5 wt % based on a combination of a plagioclase-liquid and olivine-saturated liquid geohygrometers and MELTS calculations. The estimated melt segregation temperature ranges from 1330 to 1500A degrees C, at pressures from 1 center dot 7 to 2 center dot 8 GPa under hydrous conditions. Melting temperature and pressure decreased with time, whereas the water content of the primary melts increased. Corresponding temporal decreases in high field strength element (HFSE) abundances and HFSE/large ion lithophile element (LILE) ratios require progressive melt extraction and aggregation from a melting mantle with a continuous and gradually increasing input of H2O-rich fluid or melt into the melting system. The estimated isotope composition of influxed fluid lies on a mixing line between the sediment and altered oceanic crust of the Philippine Sea Plate, with strong affinity to the sediment composition. Based on the temporal variation of the magmas and the melting model, we propose small-scale upwelling (c. 70 km in diameter) of a dry mantle peridotite that interacts progressively with the overlying wet mantle wedge. The wet mantle wedge was previously hydrated by fluids from sediments from the subducted Philippine Sea Plate, whereas the deep and dry mantle could have been derived from the mantle beneath the subducted Pacific Plate through a slab window."

                        "en": "Major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope data for whole-rocks and major element data for minerals within basalt samples from the Chugaryeong volcano, an intra-plate back-arc volcanic centre in the central part of the Korean Peninsula, are used to address the process of magma genesis in the deep back-arc region of eastern Asia. There are two lava flow units at Chugaryeong volcano: the Chongok (0 center dot 50 Ma) and the Chatan (0 center dot 15 Ma) basalts. These basalts have similar MgO (9 center dot 1-10 center dot 4 wt %) but exhibit differences in their major and trace element and isotope compositions. The Chongok basalt has higher TiO2, Al2O3, Na2O, K2O, P2O5, Cr2O3, large ion lithophile elements (LILE), high field strength elements (HFSE), and rare earth elements (REE), and lower FeO*, SiO2, and CaO than the Chatan basalt. In addition, the Chongok basalt has more radiogenic Nd-143/Nd-144 and Pb-206/Pb-204, and less radiogenic Sr-87/Sr-86 and Pb-208/Pb-204 than the Chatan basalt. Chi-square tests for the major elements indicate that crystal fractionation can explain the chemical variations within each basalt suite; intra-crustal processes, including crystal fractionation and assimilation of continental crust, cannot result in the formation of one basalt suite from the other. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of the Chongok and Chatan basalts plot on mixing hyperbolae between peridotite mantle xenoliths from the area and a fluid flux derived from a mixture of ancient and recent sediments. The trace element compositions of the estimated primary melts for the two basalt suites suggest different degrees of partial melting of a common enriched mantle source that was metasomatized by a Ba-, K-, Pb-, and Sr-rich fluid. The estimated degree of melting increased with time from similar to 7 center dot 5% for the Chongok basalt to similar to 10% for the Chatan basalt. The source mantle for the Chatan basalt is more enriched in Ba and Pb, indicating a greater fluid flux than for the Chongok basalt. This suggests that melting of the source mantle increased with time, sustained by an increased sediment-derived fluid flux from the deeper upper mantle."

                        "en": "The present study aims to constrain the composition of the initial lunar magma ocean (LMO) with fluid dynamic and thermodynamic consideration. A plausible range of the initial LMO composition is investigated by developing an incremental polybaric fractional crystallization model with variable fractionation efficiency to satisfy three conditions for the anorthosite crust formation: (1) the amount of anorthite crystallized from the LMO is abundant enough to form the crust with the observed thickness, (2) the Mg# (=Mg/(Mg + Fe)) of orthopyroxene crystallized with anorthite in the cooling LMO is consistent with that observed in the lunar highland rocks, ferroan anorthosite, and (3) crystallized anorthite separated to float in the turbulent LMO. A plausible range of FeO and Al2O3 contents of the bulk LMO is successfully constrained as a crescent region tight for FeO and loose for Al2O3. The FeO content must be higher than 1.3 times the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) and lower than 1.8 xBSE unless the Al2O3 content of the Moon is extremely higher than the Earth. These upper and lower limits for FeO are positively correlated with the initial Al2O3 content and fractionation efficiency. The FeO-rich LMO composition may suggest that the circum-Earth disk just after the giant impact of the Earth-Moon system formation was more oxidizing or the impactor was richer in FeO than the Earth's mantle.

It was shown that the kelyphitization of garnet took place in three stages: (1) the garnet-olivine reaction, accompanied by a long-range material transfer across the reaction zone, and (2) the isochemical breakdown of garnet, essentially in a chemically-closed system, and finally, (3) an open-system hydration reaction producing a thin hydrous zone (amphibole+spinel+plagioclase), which is located between the isochemical kelyphite and relict garnet. The presence of relict garnet suggests that this breakdown reaction of the second stage did not proceed to a completion probably being hindered by the formation of the hydrous zone at the reaction front. It was found by electron back-scattered diffraction method that orthopyroxene and spinel do not show any topotaxic relationship in the first type of kelyphite; whereas they show locally topotaxic relationship in the isochemical kelyphite. The transition from the first type to the second type of kelyphite is discussed on the basis of the detailed observations in the transition zone between the two kelyphites. More widespread occurrence of isochemical kelyphite is expected to occur in orogenic peridotites as well as from xenoliths brought by volcanics."

The D (Mg-Fe) shows the anisotropy (largest along the [001] direction and smallest along the [100] direction), and its activation energy (280-320 kJ/mol) is similar to 80-120 kJ/mol higher than that estimated at lower temperatures. The D (Mg-Fe) at temperatures of &gt; 1,400 A degrees C can be explained by the cation-vacancy chemistry determined both by the Fe3+/Fe2+ equilibrium and by the intrinsic point defect formation with the formation enthalpy of 220-270 kJ/mol depending on the thermodynamical model for the Fe3+/Fe2+ equilibrium in olivine. The formation enthalpy of 220-270 kJ/mol for the point defect (cation vacancy) in olivine is consistent with that estimated from the Mg self-diffusion in Fe-free forsterite. The increase in the activation energy of D (Mg-Fe) at &gt; 1,400 A degrees C is thus interpreted as the result of the transition of diffusion mechanism from the transition metal extrinsic domain to the intrinsic domain at the atmospheric pressure."

Such an unradiogenic Os isotopic signature is consistent with the less oxidized condition at subduction initiation. The major and trace element characteristics of the harzburgite, together with its petrography and relatively high modal abundance of clinopyroxene, suggest an involvement of a carbonate-rich silicate melt during melt extraction in arc setting."

                        "en": "The role of oxygen isotope exchange during evaporation and condensation of silicate melt is quantitatively evaluated. Silicate dusts instantaneously heated above liquidus temperature are assumed to cool in gas and experience partial evaporation and subsequent recondensation. The results show that isotopic exchange effectively suppresses mass-dependent O-isotope fractionation even if the degree of evaporation is large, which is the fundamental difference from the case without isotopic exchange. The final composition of silicate melt strongly depends on the initial abundance of oxygen in the ambient gas relative to that in silicate dust, but not on the cooling rate of the system. The model was applied to O-isotope evolution of silicate melts in isotopically distinct gas of the protoplanetary disk. It was found that deviation from a straight mixing line toward the d18O-rich side on the three-oxygen isotope diagram is inevitable when mass-dependent fractionation and isotopic exchange take place simultaneously; the degree of deviation depends on the abundance of oxygen in an ambient gas and isotopic exchange efficiency. The model is applied to explain O-isotopic compositions of igneous CAIs and chondrules."

                        "en": "Congruent evaporation of a crystalline material in vacuum is an extreme reaction in that backward reactions and transport processes in the reactant can be neglected. The evaporation is strongly governed by surface processes and intrinsic nature of the substance. A thorough knowledge of the atomistic evaporation mechanism is fundamental for better understanding reaction kinetics between gas and condensed materials in general. We have conducted a series of evaporation experiments of forsterite in vacuum for crystallographically oriented surfaces at 1500 to 1810 degrees C. The (100), (010), and (001) surfaces developed their own morphology characterized by evaporation pits and grooves originated from dislocation outcrops. Nominal overall evaporation rate (average retreat rate of a surface) shows significant anisotropy with the maximum difference by a factor of five below 1740 degrees C. The overall evaporation rates for individual surfaces are fitted with respective Arrhenius relationships, giving the highest activation energy for (100), intermediate for (001), and the lowest for (010). The anisotropy decreases to within 50% at similar to 1800 degrees C, which is caused by enhancement of evaporation from (010) owing to preferential evaporation around dislocation outcrops. \"Intrinsic evaporation rates\" estimated by subtracting contributions of initial roughness and the preferential evaporation around dislocations from the nominal overall evaporation rates show substantial anisotropy even at similar to 1800 degrees C. The \"intrinsic evaporation rate\" for (010) is adequately fitted by an Arrhenius relationship over the examined temperature range giving a single activation energy of 655 kJ/mol. The prevalence of steps with submicrometer to nanometer-scale height shows that forsterite evaporates mostly by layer-by-layer mechanism. The only exception is the (001) surface above similar to 1650 degrees C, on which such steps are absent except for surface-parallel minor facets which are rapidly diminishing with time. The (001) surface is inferred to evaporate by direct detachment mechanism at high temperatures. The change of evaporation mechanisms for (001) at around 1650 degrees C corresponds to a rough-smooth transition kinetically induced by an atomistic evaporation process."

                        "en": "Homogeneous fractionation, involving crystal nucleation, growth, and separation from a melt-dominant magma, and boundary-layer fractionation, involving the separation of a fractionated interstitial melt from a crystal-dominant boundary layer and its mixing with the main magma body, have been advocated as two major differentiation mechanisms in a crustal magma chamber. In this study, we focus on one of the dolerite sills in the Aosawa area, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, to elucidate the roles of the two mechanisms in the differentiation of a sheet-like magma body. The intrusion is concordantly intruded into black mudstone and is similar to 100 m thick and more than 5 km in lateral extension. The chilled margins contain olivine (5.3 vol%) and plagioclase (1.9 vol%) as phenocrysts. There is an absence of clinopyroxene in the chilled margins, and there are systematic sill-scale variations in the whole-rock major-and trace-element contents that require the addition or removal of clinopyroxene. These findings suggest sill-scale differentiation, involving the transportation of crystals that nucleated and grew in the sill, and/or the transfer of the residual melt. The downward increases in mode and size of clinopyroxene and in the size of the most dominant plagioclase, all with maxima near the bottom, and the occurrence of pigeonite rimming augite only near the bottom, suggest a slower cooling rate in the lower boundary layer compared to the upper one. Clinopyroxene crystals with Cr-rich cores that show textures suggesting rapid growth, such as remarkable sector zoning, melt inclusions, and small euhedral plagioclase, are more abundant at 5-15 m above the lower contact. These observations lead us to believe that clinopyroxene nucleated and grew near the upper boundary layer, where large supersaturation occurred, and then settled to concentrate in the lower boundary layer, where slower cooling provided suitable conditions for pigeonite crystallization. The upward increase in the incompatible elements and the decrease in compatible elements from the zone containing a high concentration of Cr-rich clinopyroxene suggest that a fractionated melt, which was formed through enhanced overgrowth on settled clinopyroxene, was transported upwards. The sill-scale magmatic differentiation in the Aosawa dolerite intrusion took place through crystal settling from the roof boundary layer, followed by the upward transportation of the fractionated melt from the bottom boundary layer. The lower-boundary-layer fractionation was probably very effective because the settling of the crystals thickened the bottom boundary layer to facilitate an effective melt-crystal separation."

                        "en": "The mechanism of fractionation in a sheet-like magma body was investigated based on observations from the Nosappumisaki intrusion, northern Japan. This is one of a number of late Cretaceous shoshonite sills in the Nemuro peninsula and has a compound structure comprising a bottom cumulate zone containing similar to 50 vol. % cumulus crystals and a overlying middle zone free of such cumulus crystals. These zones are sandwiched between porphyritic rocks of upper and lower chilled and marginal zones. It is inferred that massive crystal settling or flotation from a magma initially laden with similar to 20 vol. % of crystals (primocrysts) in a sheet-like magma body formed a cumulus pile and an overlying crystal-free melt layer. After the formation of the compound structure with partial freezing of the upper and lower marginal zones, the internal part of the intrusion slowly solidified. During this period the melt in the central part of the intrusive sheet underwent fractional crystallization. This is shown by patterns of vertical variation in the composition of the interstitial melt. The overall patterns are inverted (mirror-image) S-shaped and S-shaped for incompatible and compatible elements, respectively. The incompatible element abundances show maxima near the bottom of the middle zone, which corresponds to the final solidification horizon. They show minima in the cumulate zone, which suggests discharge of an evolved melt from the crystal pile. Fractionation is inferred to have taken place via compositional convection without settling of crystals grown after the intrusion event or collapse of the upper boundary layer. The melt in the central melt layer descended into the permeable crystal pile counterbalancing discharge of buoyant evolved melt formed by crystallization of the pore melt in the crystal pile. This conclusion is based on the following observations. (1) There is no accumulation of crystals grown after the intrusion of the magma above the cumulate zone. (2) Leucocratic pipe-like structures, which represent relict pathways for the evolved melt, are developed in the cumulate zone. These structures increase in diameter, decrease in number density, and increase in abundance of incompatible elements with height. (3) Cumulus augite in the cumulate zone has Ca-rich and Al-poor dissolved rims. The extent of dissolution increases with stratigraphic height, suggesting downwelling of an H2O-rich melt from the overlying melt layer. (4) There is no evidence for extensive compaction accompanying pore melt crystallization in the main part of the cumulate zone. (5) The initial melt composition estimated from the groundmass of the chilled margin rocks and the average composition of the material interstitial to the primocrysts for the whole sill are statistically identical. A mass-balance model for compositional convection was constructed to quantify the melt transportation processes. Model parameters were optimized by fitting the observed vertical variation of the interstitial melt compositions. The optimized results suggest that the evolved melts discharged from the crystal pile and rose through the central melt layer as plumes with minor mingling with the surrounding melt. The initially formed compound structure is a highly preferential environment for compositional convection."

                        "en": "Metallic iron is one of the most abundant condensing materials in systems of solar abundance. Because metallic iron is responsible for the continuum opacity of dust particles, it has a large contribution to the thermal structure of circumstellar environments and hence to dust evolution itself. In order to understand the formation processes of metallic iron in circumstellar environments, condensation and evaporation kinetics of metallic iron were studied experimentally. Metallic iron condenses at the maximum rate with the condensation coefficient (a parameter ranging from 0 to 1 to represent kinetic hindrance for surface reaction) of unity under high supersaturation conditions, and evaporates nearly ideally (evaporation coefficient of unity) in vacuum. On the other hand, evaporation of metallic iron takes place with more kinetic hindrance in the presence of metallic iron vapor. It is also found that metallic iron atoms nucleate heterogeneously on Al(2)O(3). Metallic iron does not necessarily condense homogeneously in circumstellar environments, but might condense through heterogeneous nucleation on pre-existing dust. Metallic iron formation proceeds with little kinetic hindrance for highly unequilibrated conditions, but the effects of kinetic hindrance may appear for evaporation and condensation occurring near equilibrium with a timescale of months to years in protoplanetary disks."

We studied crystallographic relationships among constituent (product) phases of kelyphite - orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, spinel and reactant phases, garnet and olivine, using EBSD and found that, for a relatively high temperature sample (from Czech Moldanubian), spinel and pyroxenes are in a topotaxic relationship in such a way that spinel {111} coincides with pyroxene (100) and spinel {110} coincides with pyroxene (010); while the topotaxy is incomplete or non for a lower-temperature sample (from western Norway). On the basis of the observed microstructural and crystallographic relationships, we propose a hypothesis that the topotaxic relationship may be established at nucleation stages of the onset of the kelyphitization and that the degree of topotaxy may be related to the transformation temperature and the degree of supersaturation of the reaction. The lower the temperature, the higher the supersaturation and, therefore, more rapid the nucleation becomes, resulting in a more disordered state in topotaxic relationship."

                        "en": "Systematic petrological, geochemical, and chronological studies of Cenozoic intra-plate volcanism in southwestern Japan, in the Kita-Matsuura area in northwestern Kyushu, reveal temporal and spatial changes in mantle melting processes on a time scale of similar to 2.5 Myr and a horizontal scale of similar to 35 km. The most extensive basaltic activity in the area occurred between 8.5 and 6.0 Ma. Four vertical sections through the volcanic sequence from the underlying basement to the top flows were studied to encompass the distribution of the Kita-Matsuura basalt. In the central and western sections (Hirado, Senryu, and Ishimori) there is a temporal variation in the chemical composition of the basalts: volcanism initiated eruption of mildly alkaline basalts (low- to medium-SiO(2) group) followed by major flows of sub-alkaline basalt (medium- to high-SiO(2) group). The eastern section (Kunimi section) is characterized by mildly alkaline basalts (low-SiO(2) group). Each SiO(2) group has a distinctive phenocryst assemblage and major element composition. The Zr/Y, Nb/Th, and Nb/Y ratios of the Kita-Matsuura basalts are positively correlated, which cannot be explained by assimilation of crustal materials but instead is linked to melting processes in the mantle. The average segregation depth of the inferred parental magmas of the three groups decreases in the order of SiO(2) enrichment, indicating a temporal decrease in melt segregation depth in the central and western sections. The correlation between Zr/Y and Nb/Y can be reproduced by a series of instantaneous melts resulting from decompressional critical melting of a primitive mantle source with similar to 2% trapped melt. In each section, both Zr/Y and Nb/Y decrease upwards, which implies an increase in the degree of melting with time. The temporal and spatial variations in basalt chemistry are most plausibly accounted for by progressive melt extraction during mantle upwelling, which started in the garnet stability field (similar to 3.0 GPa) and ended in the spinel field (similar to 1.5 GPa). Upwelling was centred beneath the Hirado section, in the westernmost area in Kita-Matsuura, with a diameter inferred to be greater than 70 km."
