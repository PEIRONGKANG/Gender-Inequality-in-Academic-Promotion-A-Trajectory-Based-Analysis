                        "en": "Glucose dehydrogenase (GIDH) and ferrocene were coadsorbed on a carbon felt (CF) sheet (5 x 10 mm, 2 mm thickness), which was used to construct an electrode for the electrochemical detection of glucose. A potential of +0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied on the base CF, and the current was measured. After the addition of glucose, the current increased and reached a steady state within 50 s. The current response was proportional to the glucose concentration up to 20 mu M, with a lower detection limit of 1 mu M. The surface of the CF electrode was covered by layers of polystyrene sulfonate and poly-L-lysine using layer-by-layer technique. Again the current response was proportional to glucose concentration up to 20 mu M, with a lower detection limit of 2 mu M. The oxidation current owing to electrochemical interferents such as L-ascorbate and acetaminophen was 1/8 times of the current observed on the unprotected electrode. In addition, the protection imparted stability to the electrode. Our work demonstrates that a GIDH/ferrocene CF electrode, protected with polystyrene sulfonate and poly-L-lysine, could be used for the electrochemical detection of glucose."

                        "en": "A cellulose-based glucose oxidase membrane was prepared on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The current response of the electrode to glucose was measured by applying a potential of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl on the base GC and was proportional to the concentration of glucose up to 1 mM. The long-term stability of the electrode was examined by measuring the daily glucose response. Over four months, the response magnitude was maintained and then gradually decreased. After 11 months, though the response magnitude decreased to 50% of the initial value, the linear response range did not change. Therefore, the electrode could be used as a glucose biosensor even after 11 months of use. The entrapment of the enzyme in the cellulose matrix promoted the stability of the enzyme, as revealed by data on the enzyme activity after the enzyme electrode was immersed in urea. Therefore, the cellulose matrix may be used to improve the performance of biosensors, bioreactors and bio-fuel cells."

                        "en": "A novel method for preparing enzyme membranes was developed. The enzyme was attached onto the electrode surface by dropping the enzyme solution and allowing it to dry. Glucose oxidase was used for entrapment. Then, the electrode surface was coated with an ionic liquid containing cellulose, and the ionic liquid was removed by immersing the electrode into water. Enzyme activity was retained in the membrane; the enzyme electrode can be used for detecting glucose in the range of 10 mu M to 1 mM, and the response time was similar to 10 s. The stability duration of the electrode was examined: the enzyme electrode could be used for glucose detection for 6 months. The membrane was observed by atomic force microscopy in the force modulation mode; crystalline and amorphous parts were intermingled. In conclusion, the cellulose membrane can be a suitable immobilization matrix for enzymes."

Current response to hydrogen peroxide on PIC-POx-TB electrode was measured at a potential of -0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl: the response time was ca. 2 min, and the response current was proportional to the hydrogen peroxide concentration up to 50 mu M. The lower detection limit was 1 mu M (signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 3). Current ratio between l-ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide at the same concentration was determined to be several percent. The PIC-POx-TB electrode was used as a hydrogen peroxide sensor. On the PIC-POx-TB electrode, glucose oxidase (GOx) was attached by the glutaraldehyde method. The GOx-PIC-POx-TB electrode was used for glucose detection. Response to glucose was proportional to the glucose concentration up to 100 mu M, and lower detection limit was 5 mu M (S/N = 3). The response current was not affected by l-ascorbate."

                        "en": "An electricity-generating bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA, was inoculated into a single-chamber, air-cathode microbial fuel cell (MFC) in order to determine the maximum electron transfer rate from bacteria to the anode. To create anodic reaction-limiting conditions, where electron transfer from bacteria to the anode is the rate-limiting step, anodes with electrogenic biofilms were reduced in size and tests were conducted using anodes of six different sizes. The smallest anode (7 cm2, or 1.5 times larger than the cathode) achieved an anodic reaction-limiting condition as a result of a limited mass of bacteria on the electrode. Under these conditions, the limiting current density reached a maximum of 1,530 mA/m2, and power density reached a maximum of 461 mW/m2. Per-biomass efficiency of the electron transfer rate was constant at 32 fmol cell-1 day -1 (178 μmol g of protein-1 min-1), a rate comparable to that with solid iron as the electron acceptor but lower than rates achieved with fumarate or soluble iron. In comparison, an enriched electricity-generating consortium reached 374 μmol g of protein-1 min-1 under the same conditions, suggesting that the consortium had a much greater capacity for electrode reduction. These results demonstrate that per-biomass electrode reduction rates (calculated by current density and biomass density on the anode) can be used to help make better comparisons of electrogenic activity in MFCs.

The hydrogen peroxide sensor was prepared as follows; poly(4-styrenesulfonate), peroxidase (POD), ferrocene and poly-L-lysine solutions were dropped on a glassy carbon electrode. After drying this electrode, LOD and glutaraldehyde solutions were dropped on the membrane to immobilize the enzyme. The electrode was immersed into a buffer solution (pH 6.5), and a potential of -0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied to detect the reduction current. Immediately after the addition Of L-lactate (10 mu M) to the test solution, the reductive current increased and reached a plateau within 20 s. The lower detection limit was 1 mu M (S/N = 3), and the ratio of the response for the interferent to that for L-lactate on the electrode was 0.18."

Although cell cultures on microstructures and nanostructures with random shapes have been studied so far, cell cultivation on well-defined nanopatterned PDMS has not been reported. PDMS was molded into stripes and pillars with nanometer- or micrometer-scale widths using a patterned glass template. Human stomach cancer cells (Kato-III) were cultured on the nanopatterned PDMS sheets. The cells adhered to the nanometer-scale stripe and became elongated as structures. They extended along the direction of the nanostructures. When the surface was thickly coated with a protein (e.g., extracellular matrix (ECM) gel), cell extension was not observed. Cultured cells selectively recognized the direction of the nanostructure. The findings in this work could lead to future developments in whole-cell-based biosensors."

                        "en": "An acetylcholine esterase (AcE)-attached polyion complex membrane containing choline oxidase (ChOD) was prepared, and was used for detecting acetylcholine. The preparation method proceeded for 2 steps. First, a polyion complex membrane containing ChOD was prepared on a glassy carbon electrode by dropping poly-L-lysine, polystylene sulfonate and ChOD solutions onto the surface. After drying, AcE was bound to the surface of the membrane using glutaraldehyde. The membrane was used to detect acetylcholine; + I V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied to the electrode to detect produced-hydrogen peroxide. Immediately after the addition of acetylcholine, the oxidative current was increased, and reached a steady state within 15 s. The response current was proportional to the acetylcholine concentration up to 0.2 mM, and the lower detection limit was 5 muM. The interfering current from L-ascorbate was rather small: the current-response ratio from the same concentrations Of L-ascorbate and acetylcholine was 60%, because of the restricted penetration Of L-ascorbate through the membrane. The long-term stability of the electrode was examined; after 40 days the magnitude of the current response became half of the initial value. Nevertheless, because the form of the calibration curve did not change, the electrode could be used for detecting acetylcholine. Based on these results, the AcE-attached polyion complex membrane containing ChOD can be used for an acetylcholine biosensor."

The current response to hydrogen peroxide on the electrode was measured in a phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) solution. The response time was found to be short (15 s). The calibration curve of hydrogen peroxide was obtained. The response to hydrogen peroxide on the electrode was found to be linear to its concentration up to 10 mu M, and the lower detection limit was 0.5 mu M (S/N = 5). The results indicate that a sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide was accomplished. Influence of an electrochemical interfering material on the current response was examined. The ratio of the current response to hydrogen peroxide/L-ascorbate was found to be ca. 10 when these substances of the same concentration (10 mu M) were injected to the test solution. Highly-sensitive biosensors were obtained by immobilizing oxidases on the surface of the POD-based electrode. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved."

The current response for the electrode was proportional to the ethanol concentration up to 1 mM, and the response time was ca. 1 min. Lower detection limit of ethanol was 50 mu M (S/N = 5). The use of 3-NTB, an oil-soluble mediator, was highly effective for obtaining the CP-based sensor with high stability: the magnitude of the ethanol response on the 3-NTB-incorporated electrode did not change during 2 weeks, whereas the CP/enzyme electrode incorporated with Toluidine blue (TB), an oil-insoluble mediator, showed much lower stability. Within 2 days, the magnitude of ethanol response for the TB-based electrode became half of the initial value. The enzyme electrode was applied to the ethanol determination in food samples: the results obtained agreed well with those obtained by the F-kit method. The enzyme electrode would be used as an ethanol biosensor. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved."

The polyion complex layer was effective for eliminating electrochemical interferents such as L-ascorbic acid, uric acid and acetaminophen, whereas the hydrogen peroxide produced through the NADH oxidase-catalyzed reaction permeated rapidly through the layer. This resulted in a rapid response with a low interference level. An alcohol dehydrogenase/NADH oxidase-bienzyme electrode was also prepared for the measurement of alcohol, and for the highly sensitive measurement of NADH, which was based on the substrate recycling with the dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction.

The factors are divided into two categories: one is dependent on the improvement of enzyme properties, and the other, on the development of supporting materials. Improvement of an enzyme itself would effectively improve its properties. However, some novel materials or novel preparation methods are required for improving the properties of supporting materials. Examples have been provided principally aimed at improvements in membrane stability."

This review discusses factors that decrease the stability, and provides two examples of enzyme membranes, a polyion complex membrane and a cellulose membrane, with which stability loss can be avoided. By using these materials, long-term stability was improved. These supporting materials could be applied to construct biosensors, bioreactors, and bio-fuel cells."

Many researchers have developed immobilization techniques to optimize these characteristics. In the last two decades, an immobilization technique that meets the desired requirements was developed by using polyelectrolytes to form complexes, based on the electrostatic binding between polycations and polyanions. This review summarizes the techniques used for the immobilization of biomolecules by polyelectrolyte complexes; it also discusses related subjects."

The permeation of electroactive species (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, L-ascorbate, urate, dopamine) through the membrane was measured by the oxidation current of species at base electrode. Permeation of the anionic species can be depressed through the anion-rich membrane, and permeation of the cation can also be regulated through the cation-rich membrane. It is obvious that the charge exclusion can be controlled by changing the component ratio of polycation and polyanion during preparation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The suppression of non-specific protein adsorption was investigated by changing the blend ratio of poly-L-lysine and poly-styrenesulfonate. With our film, the protein adsorption fell to less than 10% of that of an unmodified surface when the poly-L-lysine to poly-styrenesulfonate ratio was 4:6. We also measured the kinetic rates between tumor necrosis factor-α and anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies, which were immobilized on the film. The binding constant was calculated to be 1.5×108 (M-1), which satisfies the binding constant level for a monoclonal antibody modified on a commercially available surface."

A microchannel for the gradient mixing of two solutions and eight other microchannels for cell assay were fabricated on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrate using a soft-lithography method. The functions necessary for this bioassay, i.e., cell culturing, chemical stimulation, cell staining, and fluorescence determination, were integrated into the microfluidic chip. Eight gradient concentrations of the fluorescein solution, ranging from 1 to 98 mu g/ml, were archived at 0.1 mu l/min on a microchip. A stomach cancer cell line was cultured, and a cell viability assay was conducted using 5-Fluorouracil as an anti-cancer agent on the microchip. Cell viability changed according to the estimated concentration of the agent solution. With the microbioassay system, an anti-cancer agent test was conducted using living cells simultaneously in eight individual channels with the gradient concentration of the agent on a microchip."

                        "en": "An enzyme electrode response to the substrate (S) reduced by the addition of a species (S') that form a complex with S: an S-S' complex formed was enzymatically inactive and the complexation, of course, brought about the decrease in the free S-concentration. This could be applied to the measurements of S in a high concentration range. For example, the addition of a phenylboronic acid, which was known to form a complex with diols, to a conventional glucose oxidase (GOx)-based electrode system enabled to determine glucose up to 50 mM. Furthermore, the concentration of S' was determined from the current decrease of the enzyme electrode: the concentration of DNA could be measured by using a peroxidase (HRP)-modified electrode and leuco-methylene blue (MBred), which intercalated into DNA. In a solution containing methylene blue (MB) and hydrogen peroxide, a catalytic current was obtained on the HR-P-modified electrode owing to the MB/MBred-recycling sequences. From the decrease of the catalytic current, the concentration of DNA (from salmon testes) was determined with the detection limit of 5 ng ml(-1). (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

After polymerization, glucose oxidase (GOD) was immobilized by dropping GOD solution (1 wt.%, 20 mu l) and glutaraldehyde (0.1 wt.%, 20 mu l) solution and drying for 4 h. After immobilizing enzyme, the electrode was used for the detection of glucose by applying a +1.0V versus Ag/AgCl on the base electrode. Immediately after the addition of glucose, oxidative current was increased and reached a steady-state within 10 s. The current response was linear to the glucose concentration up to 5 mM. The lower detection limit was 0.1 mM glucose (S/N = 3). The electrode would be used as a glucose biosensor. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved."

A gold-film-coated AFM cantilever was insulated with photo resist coating and a pointed end of the AFM probe was opened by illuminating with maskless arbitrary optical micro-pattern generator. To realize precise control of probe sample distance constantly, the resulting scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)-AFM probe was operated using a dynamic force microscopy (DFM) technique with magnetic field excitation. From a steady-state voltammetric experiment, the effective electrode diameters of the probes thus prepared were estimated to be from 0.050 to 6.2 mum. The capability of this SECM-AFM probe have been tested using gold comb in the presence of Fe(CN)(3-)(6). The simultaneous imaging of the topography and electrochemical activity of the strip electrode was successfully obtained. We also used the SECM-AFM to examine in situ topography and enzymatic activity measurement. Comparison of topography and oxidation current profiles above enzyme-modified electrode showed active parts distribution of biosensor surface. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

An indicator (thioridazine) solution, a test solution (DNA solution), and a poly-L-lysine solution were successively placed on a glassy carbon electrode, and the electrode was allowed to dry; DNA was immobilized on an electrode surface by the electrostatic binding between DNA and poly-L-lysine. The electrode was immersed into a buffer solution for 15 min, and then differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was carried out: the oxidation current peak of thioridazine was observed, and its magnitude depended on the amount of DNA in the solution which was used for preparing the electrode. It could be estimated between 0.2 mug DNA (corresponds to 630 pmol nucleotides) to 20 mug DNA (63 nmol nucleotides) from the oxidation peak current of DPV. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

An amperometric creatinine-sensing electrode was inserted into the small compartment; urea-sensing, Ag/AgCl reference and auxiliary electrodes were inserted into the larg compartment. A drop of urine (5 mul), which contained a high concentration of urea (ca. 0.3 M) and a relatively low concentration of creatinine (ca. 10 mM), was injected into the small compartment. The creatinine concentration was first measured in the small compartment with a low dilution factor for the sample; then the sample diffused into the large compartment and the urea electrode response at a higher dilution factor could be obtained. The concentrations of the two components could be determined within 3.5 min."

Response to H2O2 on the electrode was measured at -0.2 V vs. Ag/ AgCl; lower detection limit was 1 muM, linear range, up to 50 muM. Current by interferants was completely prevented. In contrast, an electrode with a monolayer consisting of PIC containing hemin and ferrocene showed a discernible interfering current (current ratio by L-ascorbate to H2O2 was similar to35%). Thus the bilayer modified electrode has been proved to be useful as a H2O2-sensor even if the electrochemical interferants co-exist in the samples."

The bienzyme electrode was applied to the determination of cratine kinase (CK); the enzyme activity (4-1,000 U 1(-1)) was measured from the rate of current decrease, which was caused by the production of ADP through CK-catalyzed reaction."

                        "en": "Polyglutamate-glucose oxidase (GOD) complex was prepared, and the complex was dropped on a cysteamine-modified gold electrode to immobilize the complex; the electrostatic binding between the cysteamine on the electrode surface and the polyglutamate moiety of the complex resulted in the formation of a GOD-attached electrode. The enzyme electrode showed quick response (similar to15 s), since the enzyme layer was quite thin (enzyme-complex monolayer structure). When we use un-modified GOD instead of polyglutamate-GOD, the sensitivity of the resulting enzyme electrode was quite low. This clearly shows that the presence of polyglutamate chain of the complex is essential for the immobilization of the modified electrode surface, i.e., the polyglutamate moiety acts as an anchor part for the complex. A linear relationship between the current response on the complex immobilized electrode and the glucose concentration was observed between 5 and 100 mM. The immobilization technique can widely be applied to prepare biosensors and biochips. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "The concentration of acetic acid was determined by a combination of flow injection analysis (FIA) with amperometric trienzyme sensor detection. The enzyme sensor was prepared by immobilizing acetate kinase (AK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and pyruvate oxidase (PyOx) on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-coated electrode. AK catalyzes the phosphor-transferring reaction between acetic acid and ATP to form ADP; PK, the phosphor-transferring reaction between ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form pyruivic acid; and PyOx, the oxidation of pyruvic acid with oxygen. The oxygen consumption was monitored by using the PDMS-coated electrode without the interference from the PyOx reaction product, hydrogen peroxide. Thus the sensor-based system could be used for the determination of acetic acid from 0.05 to 20 mM with the sampling rate of 20 h-1, and was stable for a month. The FIA system could successively be applied to wines. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
