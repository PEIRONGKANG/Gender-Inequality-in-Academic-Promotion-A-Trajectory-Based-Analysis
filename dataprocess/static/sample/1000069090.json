                        "en": "An anaerobic rod-shaped thermophile was isolated from a hydrothermal vent at Suiyo Seamount, Izu-Bonin Arc, western Pacific Ocean, and was named strain MN14(T). The rods were Gram-negative-staining, non-motile without flagella, 2-4 mu m long and 0.5 mu m wide, and divided by binary fission in the mid-exponential phase. The cells were surrounded by a sheath-like structure (toga) and occurred singly or in chains. Spheroids containing multiple cells were observed not only in the stationary phase, as previously observed for species of the order Thermotogales, but also from the early exponential phase. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the peptidoglycan in rods partly disintegrated in the early growth phases and that the outer membrane of the spheroids was not completely lined with peptidoglycan. These findings suggested that the spheroids were formed from rods by the disintegration of peptidoglycan and subsequent inflation of the outer membrane. The spheroids eventually generated tiny cells in the periplasmic space, indicating a viviparous mode of proliferation in addition to binary fission. Strain MN14(T) grew at 40-75 degrees C, pH 5.0-8.2 and with 0.25-5.20% (w/v) NaCl, with optimal growth occurring at 68 degrees C, pH 6.8 and with 2.5% NaCl. The shortest doubling time was 24 min, assuming that the strain propagated only by binary fission. Elemental sulfur enhanced growth, but was not essential. Thiosulfate was not an electron acceptor for growth. The strain was a chemo-organotroph that grew on yeast extract as the sole growth substrate. Tryptone and starch supported its growth in the presence of yeast extract. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 31.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that this strain belonged to the genus Thermosipho. No significant DNA-DNA hybridization was observed between the genomic DNA of strain MN14(T) and phylogenetically related species of the genus Thermosipho. Based on this evidence, strain MN14(T) is proposed to represent a novel species, named Thermosipho globiformans sp. nov. The species epithet globiformans reflects the formation of multicellular and reproductive spheroids by the novel strain. The type strain of this species is MN14(T) (=JCM 15059(T)=DSM 19918(T))."

The major core lipid of the cell membrane in these strains was caldarchaeol (2, 2′, 3, 3′-tetra-O-di(biphytanyl)-sn-diglycerol). Five types of molecular species of the C40 isoprenoid chains having different numbers of cyclopentane rings were detected in caldarchaeol. In the strains of the genus Picrophilus, a novel molecular species of the C40 isoprenoid chain, being a C40-bicyclic isomer, was detected. An increasing degree of cyclization depending on the rising growth temperatures was observed in all the strains examined. © 2004, Japan Oil Chemists' Society. All rights reserved."

In the 85°C culture, the main core lipid of every strain was caldarchaeol (dibiphytanyldiglycerol tetraether). No cyclopentane rings were detected in the C40 isoprenoid chains of caldarchaeol from any of the tested strains. Archaeol (diphytanylglycerol diether) was also detected in these strains, and the contents were 5.9% to 42.1% for the total core lipids. The H-type caldarchaeol in which two isoprenoid chains were linked to each other by a covalent bond around the center of both isoprenoid chains was detected in 4 strains, with no relationship to the classification of the genera. The profile of the core lipids in these strains showed that the core lipid composition of Thermococcales is close to that of the thermophilic methanogen in Euryarchaeota. © 2004, Japan Oil Chemists' Society.

                        "en": "A spherical thermoacidophilic archaeon, strain TA-2, was obtained from acidic hot springs located in Ohwaku Valley, Hakone, Japan. This isolate is an obligate aerobic chemoorganoheterotroph that grows optimally at about 75°C, pH2.8. The G + C content of DNA from TA-2 is 47 mol%.The 16S rRNA gene from TA-2 showed more than 99% similarity with those of Metallosphaera sedula and Metallosphaera prunae and less than 92% similarity with other members of the order Sulfolobales. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments showed more than 93% genomic DNA homology among TA-2, M. sedula DSM5348T, and M. prunae DSM10039T. However, TA-2 lacks calditoglycerocaldarchaeol derivatives, which are usually found in the membrane lipids of members of the order Sulfolobales. Therefore, calditoglycerocaldarchaeol may not be essential for survival in thermophilic and acidophilic environments. The isolate was deposited as Metallosphaera sedula TA-2 (JCM 9064, IFO 15160). © Springer-Verlag 2001."

                        "en": "Living organisms on the Earth which are divided into three major domains - Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya, probably came from a common ancestral cell. Because there are many thermophilic microorganisms near the root of the universal phylogenetic tree, the common ancestral cell should be considered to be a thermophilic microorganism. The existence of a cell is necessary for the living organisms; the cell membrane is the essential structural component of a cell, so its amphiphilic property is vital for the molecule of lipids for cell membranes. Tetraether type glycerophospholipids with C-40 isoprenoid chains are major membrane lipids widely distributed in archaeal cells. Cyclization number Of C-40 isoprenoid chains in thermophilic archaea influences the fluidity of lipids whereas the number of carbons and degree of unsaturation in fatty acids do so in bacteria and eucarya. In addition to the cyclization of the tetraether lipids, covalent bonding of two C-40 isoprenoid chains was found in hyperthermophiles. These characteristic structures of the lipids seem to contribute to their fundamental physiological roles in hyperthermophiles. Stereochemical differences between G-1-P archaeal lipids and G-3-P bacterial and eucaryal lipids might have occurred by the function of some proteins long after the first cell was developed by the reactions of small organic molecules. We propose that the structure of lipids of the common ancestral cell may have been similar to those of hyperthermophilic archaea. (C) 2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The chemical components of GPL-K were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography and GC-MS. The sugar moiety of GPL-K and its anomeric region were analyzed by NMR assignment. The core lipid of GPL-K was caldarchaeol, and its main hydrocarbon chains were acyclic and monocyclic C-40 biphytanyl. The polar head groups were alpha-glucose and glycerophosphate. The negative FAB-MS spectrum of GPL-K confirmed that the lipid peak of m/z 1614 consists of a caldarchaeol (including one cyclopentane ring), a hexose sugar, and a glycerophosphate. We have proposed the tentative structure of GPL-K. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Several novel neutral glycolipids (GL-la, GL-lb, GL-2a, GL-2b and GL-2c) were isolated from Thermoplasma acidophilum by high-performance liquid chromatography using phenylboronic acid-silica and preparative thin-layer chromatography. The tentative structures of these lipids were characterized by the combination of gas-liquid chromatography, the methylation procedure, and H-1-NMR and FAB-mass spectrometries. The lipophilic portion of the neutral glycolipids was composed of a simple molecular species named caldarchaeol (dibiphytanyl-diglycerol tetraether). The sugar moieties of these glycolipids were composed of gulose and glucose which formed monosaccharide residues on one side or both sides of the core lipids. Gulose was attached to the terminal glycerol OH group of the core lipid with a beta-configuration and glucose being attached with an ct-configuration. The proposed structure of GL-la was gulosylcaldarchaeol and that of GL-lb was glucosylcaldarchaeol. The structures of GL-2a, GL-2b, and GL-2c were the analogs of the caldarchaeol derivatives attached by a variety of gulosyl residues or glucosyl residues on both sides of the terminal OH groups.

The core lipid of PL-Y was caldarchaeol, and that of PL-X was archaeol. The composition of the hydrocarbon chains of the PL-T core lipid was C-20 phytane and C-40 isoprenoid in a molar ratio of 2 to 1. The major molecular species of the C-40 isoprenoid was acyclic without the cyclopentane ring. These three kinds of intact phospholipids commonly had glycerophosphate residues as polar head groups. The structure of PL-T was characterized as trialkyl-type caldarchaetidylglycerol, PL-Y as caldarchaetidylglycerol, and PL-X as archaetidylglycerol."

The isolate was a strictly anaerobic chemoorganotroph capable of utilizing proteinaceous substrates such as yeast extract, peptone, tryptone and casein in the presence of elemental sulfur or ferrous iron. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 53·5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequences indicated that the isolate was a member of an ancient lineage of the Thermococcales that diverged prior to the formation of the two genera Thermococcus and Pyrococcus. On the basis of the physiological and molecular properties of the new isolate, the name Palaeococcus ferrophilus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain DMJ(T) (= JCM 10246(T)).",

All the isolates are facultatively anaerobic, and grew optimally at around 85 degrees C, ph 2.0. Isolate TA-1(T) was characterized further. The G+C content of DNA from TA-1(T) is 33 mol%. Although these properties resemble those of the genus Acidianus, the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene from strain TA-1(T) was more similar to that of species of Stygiolobus than of Acidianus. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments also indicated that strain TA-1(T) is clearly distinguished phylogenetically from the members of Acidianus, Sulfolobus and Metallosphaera. On the basis of the distinct physiological and molecular properties, we describe the new strains as members of the new genus Sulfurisphaera. The type species of the genus is Sulfurisphaera ohwakuensis, and the type strain of the species is TA-1(T) (= IFO 15161(T))."

                        "en": "We characterized a microbial strain that was isolated from a hot spring at a geothermal area in Hakone, Japan, This isolate, whose lobed-shaped cells were about 1.0 mu m in diameter, was a facultative chemolithoautotroph that required aerobic conditions for growth. The optimum pH was 3.0 (pH range, 1.0 to 4.0), and the optimum temperature was 70 degrees C (temperature range, 50 to 80 degrees C). Lithotrophically, this strain grew on elemental sulfur and reduced sulfur compounds. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 38.4 mol%. This organism contained calditoglycerocaldarchaeol, which is characteristic of members of the Sulfolobaceae. The levels of 16S rRNA sequence similarity between the new isolate and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, Sulfolobus solfataricus, and Sulfolobus shibatae were less than 89.8%. Unlike S. acidocaldarius, S. solfataricus, and S. shibatae, the new isolate utilized sugars and amino acids poorly as sole carbon sources, and the levels of DNA-DNA hybridization between the new isolate and these Sulfolobus species were very low. Phenotypically, the new isolate was also distinct from the obligately lithotrophic organism Sulfolobus metallicus. We concluded that the new organism belongs to a new Sulfolobus species, for which we propose the name Sulfolobus hakonensis."

Although there were some differences in the growth optimum temperature for these strains, these were all cultivated at 80 C and the composition of cell lipids was compared. From a comparison of 16SrRNA, Thermococcales were classified into 3 groups, Pyrococcus, Thermococcus and Palaeococcus, but no significant difference was seen among their lipid compositions. The basic structure of those main lipids was consisted of caldarchaeol in which two biphytanyl chains (C40) were contained in a molecule. In the thermoacidophilic Sulfolobales, cyclopentane rings existed in the biphytanyl chain of caldarchaeol, but no cyclopentane rings were found m the biphytanyl chains of 17 strains cultivated at 80 C. Furthermore, in the lipids of P.horikoshii, T.celer, T.guaymasensis and T.waiotapuensis, H type caldarchaeol possessing C80 hydrocarbon chain in which two biphytanyl chains were combined near the center in caldarchaeol was detected. However, the correlation of an existence of H type caldarchaeol with the phylogenetic classification were not seen. When compared with results of the thin layer chromatograms of polar lipids, the almost same pattern was shown. Also when ESI-MS of the total lipids of some strains was measured, the molecular ion peaks common to m/z894, and m/z1543 and m/z1786 were observed in negative ion mode. The molecular ion peak of m/z894 is equivalent to the combination of archaeol, one pentose or inositol, and phosphoric acid. And m/z1543 corresponds to the molecular ion peak shown in the combination of caldarchaeol, pentose or inositol, phosphoric acid. Moreover, m/z1786 is equivalent to the molecular ion peak in which one pentose or inositol, and phosphoric acid were combined with the molecule of m/z1543 The lipid equivalent to m/z1786, however, has not been detected from other archaea for the time being Consequently, these results indicate a possibility that the judgement whether the strain separated from high temperature area belongs to Thermococcales or not, can be done easily by the lipids analysis, because there is a characteristic feature in the lipid of Thermococcales which has not been found in other archaea."
