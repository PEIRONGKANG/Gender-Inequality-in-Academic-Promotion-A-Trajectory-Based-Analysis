It is found that the rotation angles. of the PtX6 octahedra are non-zero for all the compounds. For a given A-site cation,. increases from Cl to Br to I while for a given halide anion,. decreases from K to Rb to Cs. As a result, the largest. is found for K2PtI6.

Our results show that Cs2TiX6 possess larger absorption coefficients than CH3NH3PbX3 in the main part of the solar spectrum. Furthermore, we calculate the nuclear quadrupole coupling constant C-Q of Br-79 and I-127 for Cs2TiX6 prior to experiments and evaluate the reliability of our calculated C-Q carefully. The reliability of the calculations is confirmed by comparing the calculated and experimental C-Q for the isostructural material K2PtBr6 as well as by examining those for MAPbX(3) and CsSnI3.",

The magnetic anisotropy energy, MAE, and the spin magnetic moment, Mspin, of the Pt/TM/Pt(111) and BeO/Pt/TM/Pt(111) systems as well as those of the TM/Pt(111) and BeO/TM/Pt(111) systems are calculated in the absence of or under the EF. It is found that the MAE and its EF dependence of the BeO/Pt/TM/Pt(111) systems, especially those of the BeO/Pt/Co/Pt(111) system, are considerably large. The sign of the EF dependence is such that the MAE and M-spin are increased (decreased) when the EF increases (decreases) the number of electrons in the system. We attribute this unique behavior to the formation of the hybridized majority-spin states originated in the O 2p(z), Pt 5d(3z2 - r2), and TM 3d orbitals of the interfacial atoms."

We find that the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of the MgO/TM/Au(001) system is enhanced by the EF that decreases the number of electrons in the system. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and its EF dependence of the MgO/Fe/Au(001) system is found to be in a semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental results with successful reproduction of the sign of the measured EF dependence. Furthermore, the EF dependence of the MAE of the MgO/Co/Au(001) system is found to be very large due to the structural relaxation of the Co-O interatomic distance and the decrease in the number of electrons in the Co atom caused by the EF. This result is attributed to the general trend that the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of the Co layer is affected significantly when in contact with an inert layer at an interlayer distance of about 2 angstrom. On the contrary, we find that the MgO/TM/Au(111) system shows almost no EF dependence of the MAE. This result is attributed to the existence of a strong TM-O covalent bond associated with the oxidation of the TM atom by the O atom."

We employ two functionals of the local spin density approximation (LSDA) and two functionals of the generalized gradient approximations (GGA); the former two are the Perdew-Zunger and Perdew-Wang functionals and the latter two are the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and PBEsol functionals. We also examine the effects of the relativistic correction to the LSDA exchange part of each functional. We find that, for lattice constants, bulk moduli, and cohesive energies, the results of the calculations using the PBE functional are in the best agreement with the experimental results. On the contrary, we find that calculated total magnetic moments and one-electron energies are almost the same for all the LSDA and GGA functionals employed in this work, failing to improve the agreement between the calculated and experimental results even if the gradient and relativistic corrections are included. We also find that the relativistic correction plays minor roles in both the structural and electronic properties."

                        "en": "The barrier formation at organic-metal interfaces was studied with density functional theory (DFT). We analyzed the induced density of states in the organic molecular gap and showed that it is high enough to control the barrier formation. We calculated the interface Fermi level for contact of BCP with various metals e.g. Ca, Mg, Al, Ag, and Au surfaces. We found our calculated result in consistent with experimental (UPS) result and concluded that the barrier formation is due to the charge transfer between the metal and the states induced in BCP molecular gap.
