                        "en": "To study the role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38) activity during the process of metastasis, p38 alpha(+/-) mice were subjected to an in vivo metastasis assay. The number of lung colonies of tumor cells intravenously injected in p38 alpha(-/-) mice was markedly decreased compared with that in wild-type (WT) mice. On the other hand, the time-dependent increase in tumor volume after subcutaneous tumor cells transplantation was comparable between WT and p38 alpha(+/-) mice. Platelets of p38 alpha(+/-) mice were poorly bound to tumor cells in vitro and in vivo compared with those of WT mice. E- and P-selectin mRNAs were markedly induced in the lung after intravenous injection of tumor cells. However, the induction of these selectin mRNAs in p38 alpha(+/-) mice was weaker than that in WT mice. Furthermore, the resting expression levels of E-selectin in lung endothelial cells and P-selectin in platelets of p38 alpha(+/-) mice were suppressed compared with those of WT mice. The number of tumor cells attached on lung endothelial cells of p38 alpha(+/-) mice was significantly reduced compared with that of WT mice. The transmigrating activity of tumor cells through lung endothelial cells of p38 alpha(+/-) mice was similar to that of WT mice. These results suggest that p38 alpha plays an important role in extravasation of tumor cells, possibly through regulating the formation of tumor-platelet aggregates and their interaction with the endothelium involved in a step of hematogenous metastasis."

                        "en": "BACKGROUND. The antiangiogenic CXC chemokines interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible T-cell a chemoattractant (I-TAC) and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig) are known as members of IFN-gamma- inducible antiangiogenic CXC chemokines. However, the expression of these chemokines in highly angiogenic tumors remains poorly understood. The authors examined expression of I-TAC, Mig, and their receptor, CXCR3, in tissue samples from patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\nMETHODS. Twenty-one samples of untreated RCC and corresponding normal renal tissues were obtained from surgical specimens. The expression levels of I-TAC, Mig, and CXCR3 were investigated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, real-time RT-PCR analysis, and Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to clarify the localization of both chemokines and of CXCR3.\nRESULTS. RT-PCR analysis showed strong expression levels of I-TAC, Mig, and CXCR3 in RCC tissues and very weak or undetectable expression in normal kidney tissues. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that expression levels of I-TAC, Mig, and CXCR3 in RCC tissues were 14.9 times greater, 30.3 times greater, and 9.9 times greater compared with the levels in the corresponding normal kidney tissues, respectively (P &lt; 0.01). Western blot analysis showed Lip-regulation of I-TAC, Mig, and CXCR3 at the protein level. Immunofluorescence double stainings revealed that I-TAC coincided with pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in tumor angiogenic vessels. Mig was detected in tumor endothelial cells (TECs) and in infiltrating leukocytes. In the corresponding normal kidney tissues, neither VSMCs nor endothelial cells showed positive stainings for these chemokines. CXCR3 was expressed in both tumor cells and infiltrating leukocytes.\nCONCLUSIONS. The results revealed special feature of vascular mural cells and TECs in RCC. The up-regulated I-TAC and Mig, produced by tumor vessels, may interact with CXCR3 expressed in tumor cells, with possible pathophysiologic significance in RCC progression.(C) 2004 American Cancer Society."

The altered expression of various angiogenesis-related genes in tumour-derived endothelial cells has been investigated intensively, but there may be as yet unidentified molecules that regulate tumour angiogenesis. In the present study, the distinctive expression of regulator of G protein signalling protein 5 (RGS5) in tumour vessels in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been clarified. RGS5 is a member of the RGS superfamily and acts as a negative regulator of heterotrimeric G protein-mediated signalling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). RT-PCR showed strong expression of RGS5 in all RCCs examined, but expression was very weak or undetectable in normal kidneys. By real-time RT-PCR, the ratio of RGS5 mRNA in RCC to that in normal kidney was 6.6:1 (p = 0.0012). In situ hybridization showed strong expression of RGS5 in vessels within tumour cell nests. It was expressed neither in tumour cells nor in normal renal capillaries. Immunohistochemical staining using serial sections for endothelial cell markers (CD31 and CD34) and smooth muscle cell markers (alpha-SMA and desmin), as well as fluorescence double staining, strongly suggested that tumour endothelial cells were the main location of RGS5 in RCC. These findings suggest that RGS5 may be involved in G protein-mediated signalling in tumour vessels in human RCC. Copyright (C) 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

                        "en": "RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits and negatively regulate G protein-mediated signal transduction. In this study, we determined the cDNA sequence of a novel Caenorhabditis elegans (C elegans) RGS protein. The predicted protein, termed C2-RGS, consists of 782 amino acids, and contains a C2 domain and an RGS domain. C2 domains are typically known to be Ca2+ and phospholipid binding sites, found in many proteins involved in membrane traffic or signal transduction, and most of their biological roles are not identified. To study the function of C2-RGS protein, a series of six truncated versions of C2-RGS were constructed. When the full-length protein of C2-RGS was expressed transiently in AT 1a-293T cells, ET-1-induced Ca2+ responses were strongly suppressed. When each of the mutants with either RGS domain or C2 domain was expressed, the Ca2+ responses were suppressed moderately. Furthermore, we found that C2 domain of PLC-beta1 also had a similar moderate inhibitory effect. RGS domain of C2-RGS bound to mammalian and C elegans Galphai/o and Galphaq subunits only in the presence of GDP/AlF4-, and had GAP activity to GalphaiB. On the other hand, C2 domains of C2-RGS and PLC-beta1 also bound strongly to Galphaq subunit, in the presence of GDP, GDP/AlF4-, and GTPgammaS, suggesting the stable persistent association between these C2 domains and Galphaq subunit at any stage during GTPase cycle. These results indicate that both the RGS domain and the C2 domain are responsible for the inhibitory effect of the full-length C2-RGS protein on Galphaq-mediated signaling, and suggest that C2 domains of C2-RGS and PLC-beta1 may act as a scaffold module to organize Galphaq and the respective whole protein molecule in a stable signaling complex, both in the absence and presence of stimulus.

To clarify the role of GRK2 other than that as a kinase, we characterized an RGS (regulator of G protein signaling)-like domain in the amino-terminus of GRK2. Both GRK2(1-181) and GRK2(54-174) suppressed Ca2+ responses induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) and ET-1, and bound directly with G alpha q but not G alpha s nor G alpha i3 in the presence of GDP and AlF4-. These results demonstrate that GRK2 regulates Gq-mediated signaling negatively by direct interaction between its RGS domain and the transitional state of G alpha q, as well as through phosphorylation of activated receptors by its kinase domain."

In cells expressing the wild type or Delta 40 ETBR, ET-1 caused rapid desensitization of calcium responses. The wild type ETBR was phosphorylated by biotinylated ET-1, and the phosphorylation was markedly enhanced by coexpression with G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). However, Delta 40 ETBR was not phosphorylated regardless of coexpression with GRK2. On the other hand, ET-1-induced IP3 formation in these cells was decreased by coexpression with GRK2 or catalytically inactive Lys220Arg GRK2 to the similar extent. The present study demonstrates the presence of phosphorylation-independent desensitization mechanism in Delta 40 ETBR and suggests that GRK2 might play a role other than that as a kinase."

                        "en": "Endothelin (ET) receptors involved in ET-l-induced responses of the longitudinal muscle of the isolated guinea pig ileum were studied. ET-1 caused concentration-dependent contractions, while ET-3 and selective ET(B)-receptor agonists, IRL1620 and sarafotoxin 6c (S6c), showed little or no effect. The ET-1-induced contractions were antagonized by BQ-123, an ET(A)-receptor antagonist, or PD142893, an ET(A)/ET(B)-receptor antagonist, indicating that the contraction is mediated by the ETA receptor. In preparations precontracted with carbachol, ET-1 elicited relaxations at lower concentrations and contractions at higher concentrations. ET-3, IRL1620 and S6c caused relaxations. These relaxations were little affected by BQ-123, but greatly antagonized by PD142893. The ET-1-induced relaxations were slightly affected by BQ-788, an ET(B)-receptor antagonist, but were markedly inhibited by the combination of BQ-788 and BQ-123. In ET(B) receptor-desensitized preparations, ET-1-induced relaxations were antagonized by BQ-123, whereas ET-3, S6c and IRL1620 showed no response. All these relaxations were abolished by apamin. These results indicate that ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mediate relaxation of the ileal smooth muscle through activation of apamin-sensitive K+ channels."

                        "en": "To study endothelin receptor subtypes that mediate the smooth muscle contraction of human saphenous vein, effects of some endothelin-receptor agonists and antagonists were examined. Endothelin (ET)-1 and sarafotoxin 6b (S6b) elicited potent concentration-dependent contractions with similar PD2 values and similar maximal responses. Selective ET(B)-receptor agonists, sarafotoxin 6c (S6c) and IRL1620 (Suc-[Glu(9), Ala(11,15)]-endothelin-1(8-21)), also caused contractions, but their maximal responses were about one third of that of ET-1. ET-3 showed a biphasic concentration-response curve. An ET(A)-receptor antagonist, BQ-123 (cyclo(-D-Asp-L-Pro-D-Val-L-Leu-D-Trp-)) an ET(A)/ET(B)-receptor antagonist, PD142893 (Ac-D-Dip-Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-Trp), or the combination of these two antagonists hardly affected the contractile effect of ET-1, while each of them markedly antagonized the effects of higher concentrations of ET-3 and S6b. Contractions induced by lower concentrations of ET-3 and S6b were resistant to these antagonists. The concentration-response curves for S6c and IRL1620 were not affected by BQ-123. The effect of IRL1620 was markedly inhibited by PD142893, while S6c-induced contractions were much more resistant to PD142893. These different sensitivities to antagonists suggested heterogeneity of both ET(A)- and ET(B)-receptors [ET(Al) (sensitive to BQ-123), ET(A2) (resistant to BQ-123), ET(A2) (sensitive to PD142893) and ET(B2) (resistant to PD142893)] in the human saphenous vein, although contractions mediated by ET(B)-subtypes have smaller maximal responses than those mediated by the ET(A)-subtypes."

After desensitization of endothelin ET(B) receptors by pretreatment with sarafotoxin S6c, endothelin-1 and sarafotoxin S6b and a high concentration of endothelin-3 caused dose-dependent contractions. However, endothelin-1-induced contractions were much less sensitive to an endothelin ET(A) receptor antagonist, BQ-123 (cyclo(-D-AsP-L-Pro-D-Val-L-Leu-D-Trp-)), than sarafotoxin S6b-induced responses. The pA(2) values of BQ-123 for endothelin-1- and sarafotoxin S6b-induced contractions were 5.69 and 7.65, respectively. These results suggest pharmacological heterogeneity of endothelin ET(A) receptors in the rabbit saphenous vein."

                        "en": "The biosynthetic pathway of endothelin (ET)-2 was analyzed in cultured ACHN cells. In the supernatant, we detected three ET-2-related peptides, ET-2, big ET-2(1-38) and big ET-2(22-38). Phosphoramidon decreased the amount of ET-2 and increased that of big ET-2(1-38) dose-dependently. The amount of big ET-2(1-37) did not significantly change. These results suggest that big ET-2 is composed of 38 and not 37 amino acid residues, and that a putative ET-2-converting enzyme (ECE-2) should be classified as a phosphoramidon-sensitive neutral metalloprotease, bearing a resemblance to the putative ET-1-converting enzyme (ECE-1) in endothelial cells."
