The crowns were fabricated and delivered in a uniform way according to the students' clinical manual used in the Department of Fixed Prosthodontics, School of Dentistry, Iwate Medical University.<br><b><i>Results</i> : </b>The 226 participants (61 men and 165 women with a mean age of 41.6 years) attended a recall examination between 1996 and 1997. Periodontal pocket depth was 2.2±0.1 mm (mean±S.D.) at the initial examination and 2.2±0.8 mm (mean±S.D.) at the recall examination. The gingival index at the initial visit indicated that 90.3% of recall subjects had either slight gingival inflammation or none at all. A 10-16 year follow-up examination on the 388 crowns revealed that 38 crowns (9.8%) were lost or replaced due to periodontal disease, caries, and/or fracture. Of the failed crowns, 19 abutments were extracted, 11 crowns were removed and remade as an abutment of a fixed bridge, and 8 crowns were replaced by new crowns. The survival rates of the crowns at 5, 10 and 16 years after placement were 96.9, 93.3, and 84.9%, respectively.<br><b><i>Conclusion</i> : </b>Although the recall rate of this follow-up study was low, it is suggested that the periodontal status at the initial stage of treatment played an important role in achieving a high survival rate of the crown. Following an approved procedural manual together with a fabrication manual and careful checking by a senior instructor were also thought to contribute to the excellent survival rate of the crowns.",

The crowns were fabricated and delivered in a uniform way according to the students' clinical manual used in the Department of Fixed Prosthodontics, School of Dentistry, Iwate Medical University.<br><b><i>Results</i> : </b>The 226 participants (61 men and 165 women with a mean age of 41.6 years) attended a recall examination between 1996 and 1997.

Patients having maxillary defectsshowed the vowel sounds for /17, / u/, and / e/ to be located mostly outside the normal equiprobabilityellirsoid. The F 1 value for ratients havinz maxillarv defects tended to increase slizhtlv for /i/ andincrease as well as decrease for /e/. Vowel sounds /a/, /U/, and /o/ remained within the normalrange. On the otherhand, the F 2 value tended to increase for / a/, / u/ and / o/, and decrease for /i/and /e/ for patients having maxillary defects.In conclusion, compared to H l type maxillary defects, H 3 and H 4 type showed most vowelsounds to be located outside the normal equiprobability ellipsoid. However, the vowel sounds werefound to be within the normal range when the patients wore their dentures."

However, it was quite difficult to accurately assess thechange in skin color at times. Therefore, a new colorimetric diagnostic system capable of objectively evaluating color was developed to overcome this problem. This was made possible with the aidof a computer and spectrophotometer capable of making longitudinal colorimetric studies andanalyses. When this new diagnostic approach was compared to the conventional subjective one, thefollowing characteristics were obtained for positive testing ones :1 . Spectral reflectance curve was of the absorption type.2. Depth of shade (Labe ?) increased.3. A high color difference (dE) value was observed.4. According to the Munsell system, the hue moved toward YR.5. Lightness decreased and there was no change in chromaticity.6. According to the CIELAB color system, there was a decrease in L', an increase in a', anda decrease in b'.In conclusion, characteristics of this new objective approach showed significant differences indE, spectral reflectance curve, Labe 0, and L', a', b', and Lightness when comparing the negativeand positive groups."

Patients having maxillary defectsshowed the vowel sounds for /17, / u/, and / e/ to be located mostly outside the normal equiprobabilityellirsoid. The F 1 value for ratients havinz maxillarv defects tended to increase slizhtlv for /i/ andincrease as well as decrease for /e/. Vowel sounds /a/, /U/, and /o/ remained within the normalrange. On the otherhand, the F 2 value tended to increase for / a/, / u/ and / o/, and decrease for /i/and /e/ for patients having maxillary defects.In conclusion, compared to H l type maxillary defects, H 3 and H 4 type showed most vowelsounds to be located outside the normal equiprobability ellipsoid. However, the vowel sounds werefound to be within the normal range when the patients wore their dentures."
