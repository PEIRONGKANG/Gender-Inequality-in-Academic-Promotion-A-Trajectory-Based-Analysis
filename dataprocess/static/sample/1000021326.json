                        "en": "Chronic moderate exercise has been reported to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines. To analyze the molecular mechanisms by which training exerts these effects, the epigenetic influences of age and exercise on the ASC gene, which is responsible for IL-1 beta and IL-18 secretion, were investigated by ASC gene methylation. Further, the relationship between carcinogenesis and exercise, and methylation of the p15 tumor suppressive gene was also analyzed. High-intensity interval walking exercise, consisting of 3 min low-intensity walking at 40% of peak aerobic capacity followed by a 3 min high-intensity walking period above 70% of peak aerobic capacity, was continued for 6 months. Peripheral blood DNA extracts from young control (n = 34), older control (n = 153), and older exercise (n = 230) groups were then analyzed by pyrosequencing for DNA methylation. Methylation of ASC decreased significantly with age (young control vs. older control, p &lt; 0.01), which is indicative of an age-dependent increase in ASC expression. Compared to the older control group, the degree of ASC methylation was higher in the older exercise group (older control vs. older exercise: p &lt; 0.01), and presumably lower ASC expression. Neither exercise nor age affected the methylation of the p15. In summary, chronic moderate exercise appears to attenuate the age-dependent decrease in ASC methylation, implying suppression of excess pro-inflammatory cytokines through reduction of ASC expression."

                        "en": "Chronic moderate exercise has been reported to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines. To analyze the molecular mechanisms by which training exerts these effects, the epigenetic influences of age and exercise on the ASC gene, which is responsible for IL-1 beta and IL-18 secretion, were investigated by ASC gene methylation. Further, the relationship between carcinogenesis and exercise, and methylation of the p15 tumor suppressive gene was also analyzed. High-intensity interval walking exercise, consisting of 3 min low-intensity walking at 40% of peak aerobic capacity followed by a 3 min high-intensity walking period above 70% of peak aerobic capacity, was continued for 6 months. Peripheral blood DNA extracts from young control (n = 34), older control (n = 153), and older exercise (n = 230) groups were then analyzed by pyrosequencing for DNA methylation. Methylation of ASC decreased significantly with age (young control vs. older control, p &lt; 0.01), which is indicative of an age-dependent increase in ASC expression. Compared to the older control group, the degree of ASC methylation was higher in the older exercise group (older control vs. older exercise: p &lt; 0.01), and presumably lower ASC expression. Neither exercise nor age affected the methylation of the p15. In summary, chronic moderate exercise appears to attenuate the age-dependent decrease in ASC methylation, implying suppression of excess pro-inflammatory cytokines through reduction of ASC expression."

                        "en": "Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC) is an adaptor molecule activating caspase-1 that stimulates prointerleukin-1 beta (pro-IL-1 beta) and pro-IL-18, two pro-inflammatory cytokines with critical functions in host defense against a variety of pathogens. In this study, we investigated the role of ASC in the host defense against Helicobacter pylori utilizing ASC-deficient mice. Mice were orally inoculated with H. pylori; bacterial load, degree of gastritis, and mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines were analyzed and compared with those obtained from wild-type mice. We found more prominent H. pylori colonization in ASC-deficient mice, as revealed by colony-forming unit counts. Both groups of mice developed gastritis; however, ASC-deficient mice showed significant attenuation of inflammation despite high H. pylori colonization. ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed complete suppression of IL-1 beta and IL-18, and substantial reduction of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression, in ASC-deficient mice without apparent upregulation of other cytokines, including IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These results as a whole indicate that ASC exerts considerable influence on the host defense, acting through IL-1 beta/IL-18 and subsequent IFN-gamma production, which in turn contributes to continuous chronic inflammatory response and consequent reduction of H. pylori colonization.

                        "en": "Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC) is an adaptor molecule activating caspase-1 that stimulates prointerleukin-1 beta (pro-IL-1 beta) and pro-IL-18, two pro-inflammatory cytokines with critical functions in host defense against a variety of pathogens. In this study, we investigated the role of ASC in the host defense against Helicobacter pylori utilizing ASC-deficient mice. Mice were orally inoculated with H. pylori; bacterial load, degree of gastritis, and mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines were analyzed and compared with those obtained from wild-type mice. We found more prominent H. pylori colonization in ASC-deficient mice, as revealed by colony-forming unit counts. Both groups of mice developed gastritis; however, ASC-deficient mice showed significant attenuation of inflammation despite high H. pylori colonization. ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed complete suppression of IL-1 beta and IL-18, and substantial reduction of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression, in ASC-deficient mice without apparent upregulation of other cytokines, including IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These results as a whole indicate that ASC exerts considerable influence on the host defense, acting through IL-1 beta/IL-18 and subsequent IFN-gamma production, which in turn contributes to continuous chronic inflammatory response and consequent reduction of H. pylori colonization.

In our previous study using a conditional transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, the overproduction of hyaluronan, a major extracellular constituent, accelerated tumor angiogenesis through stromal cell recruitment. This finding led us to investigate the role of hyaluronan in the lymphatic vessel system. Here, we have found that microenvironmental hyaluronan promoted tumor lymphangiogenesis concurrently with the formation of stromal structures. Additionally, lymphatic vessels frequently penetrated and accumulated into stromal compartments, and up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor-C and -D was detected at tumor-stromal interfaces. To assess the contribution of stromal cells to lymphangiogenesis in vivo, we established tumor-associated fibroblasts from hyaluronan-overproducing mammary tumors and implanted them together with carcinoma cells from control tumors or MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells in nude mice. Carcinoma cells grew rapidly in association with marked stromal reactions and lymphangiogenesis. Without the stromal cells, however, the tumors developed slowly with less stroma and lymphatic vessels. These findings underline the significance of tumor-associated stroma in the promotion of intratumoral lymphangiogenesis and suggest a pivotal role for the hyaluronan-rich tumor microenvironment."

We found that ASC was methylated in three of five human colon cancer cell lines lacking ASC protein expression. Demethylation treatment of these cell lines lacking ASC with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine partially restored ASC expression. Methylated ASC was also detected in six of ten colorectal cancer tissues. Although clear down-regulation of ASC in the whole region of a tumor tissue was hardly observed by immunostaining with anti-ASC mAb, complete suppression of ASC was identified in a minor population of the colorectal tumor cells. The biological significance of ASC methylation inducible ASC suppression in colorectal cancer will be discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

We found that ASC was methylated in three of five human colon cancer cell lines lacking ASC protein expression. Demethylation treatment of these cell lines lacking ASC with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine partially restored ASC expression. Methylated ASC was also detected in six of ten colorectal cancer tissues. Although clear down-regulation of ASC in the whole region of a tumor tissue was hardly observed by immunostaining with anti-ASC mAb, complete suppression of ASC was identified in a minor population of the colorectal tumor cells. The biological significance of ASC methylation inducible ASC suppression in colorectal cancer will be discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

In our study, we assessed the therapeutic effect of calponin h I on peritoneal dissemination. F10 cells were overlaid on the cultured CN+/+ or CN-/- MS cells and the effect of calponin hI on retraction of MS cells was evaluated. Then, an adenoviral vector with the calponin hI gene (AdGFP-CN) inserted was constructed and was applied to CN-/- MS cells or CN-/- mouse peritoneum to investigate its suppressive effect on the peritoneal dissemination caused by F10 cells. Greater retraction and invasion of F10 cells were observed in CN-/- MS than in CN+/+ cells in vitro, while down-regulation of calponin hI was observed in CN+/+ MS cells prior to the invasion of F10 cells. Infecting CN-/- MS cells with AdGFP-CN prevented their retraction and the invasion of F 10 cells. Peritoneal dissemination was prominently suppressed in AdGFP-CN-infected CN-/- mice, and the survival of those mice was significantly prolonged. Thus, calponin hI functioned to protect host MS cells from the invasion of F10 cells. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss. Inc."

                        "en": "Calponin is known to be an actin binding protein in smooth muscle, inhibiting actomyosin ATPase activity in vitro. We previously reported that a-adrenergic vasoconstriction in calponin knockout (KO) mice was reduced compared with that in wild-type C57BL/6J (WT) mice and, as a compensation, arterial baroreflex sensitivity in KO mice was enhanced at rest. In the present study, we assessed arterial pressure regulation in WT and KO mice during graded treadmill exercise at 5, 10, and 15 m min(-1). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) in KO mice fluctuated more than that in WT mice at every speed of exercise with two-fold higher variances (P &lt; 0.001). The baroreflex sensitivity (DeltaHR/DeltaMAP) in WT mice (n = 6), determined from the heart rate response (AHR) to spontaneous change in MAP (DeltaMAP), was -5.1 +/- 0.6 beats min(-1) mmHg(-1) (mean +/- S.E.M.) at rest and remained unchanged at -5.0 +/- 0.9 beats min(-1) mmHg(-1) during exercise (P &lt; 0.01), while that in KO mice (n = 6) was -9.9 +/- 1.7 beats min(-1) mmHg(-1) at rest, significantly higher than that in WT mice (P &lt; 0.001), and was reduced to -4.7 +/- 0.4 beats min(-1) mmHg(-1) during exercise (P &lt; 0.01), not significantly different from that in WT mice. In another experiment, we measured muscle blood flow (MBF) in the thigh by laser-Doppler flowmetry, electromyogram (EMG), and MAP during voluntary locomotion in KO (n = 7) and WT (n = 7) mice. Muscle vascular conductance, MBF/MAP, started to increase immediately after locomotion, judged from EMG, and reached 50% of the maximum after the time of 2.3 +/- 0.2 s in KO mice, shorter than 5.8 +/- 0.6 s in WT mice (P &lt; 0.001). Prior administration of alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine) shortened the time in WT mice to that in KO mice (P &lt; 0.001), but did not shorten the time in KO mice. Thus, impaired MAP regulation in KO mice during exercise was caused by a blunted muscle vascular alpha-adrenergic contractile response and by the attenuated HR response to spontaneous change in MAP due to reduced baroreflex sensitivity."

In our study, we assessed the therapeutic effect of calponin h I on peritoneal dissemination. F10 cells were overlaid on the cultured CN+/+ or CN-/- MS cells and the effect of calponin hI on retraction of MS cells was evaluated. Then, an adenoviral vector with the calponin hI gene (AdGFP-CN) inserted was constructed and was applied to CN-/- MS cells or CN-/- mouse peritoneum to investigate its suppressive effect on the peritoneal dissemination caused by F10 cells. Greater retraction and invasion of F10 cells were observed in CN-/- MS than in CN+/+ cells in vitro, while down-regulation of calponin hI was observed in CN+/+ MS cells prior to the invasion of F10 cells. Infecting CN-/- MS cells with AdGFP-CN prevented their retraction and the invasion of F 10 cells. Peritoneal dissemination was prominently suppressed in AdGFP-CN-infected CN-/- mice, and the survival of those mice was significantly prolonged. Thus, calponin hI functioned to protect host MS cells from the invasion of F10 cells. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss. Inc."
