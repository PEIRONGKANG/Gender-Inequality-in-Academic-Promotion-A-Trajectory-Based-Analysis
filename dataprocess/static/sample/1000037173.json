The stable influence of depth on visual background dynamics is due to light attenuation along the water column. Depth is also a key factor driving diversification in Sebastes rockfishes, influencing variations in several biological traits. Comparisons between closely related species suggest that brightly coloured species (red, orange, or yellow) tend to inhabit deeper waters and have slower growth rates compared to their shallow-water counterparts with dominance of dark colours (black, brown, or grey). Here, we used 377 photos from 100 Sebastes species, along with recently developed methods of colour quantification and phylogenetic comparative analyses, to assess this trend. Our analyses confirmed the separation of body colouration regarding depth, which was accompanied by differences in growth rates and morphological traits. This indicated that variations in body colourations are included in the ongoing correlational selection process dictated by depth. Analyses of closely related species indicated that depth is an initial driver of colour differentiation and that colour differences do not progressively increase with genetic divergences. We hypothesized that the bright-coloured rockfishes are found in deeper waters because in shallow environments they are more vulnerable to the potential negative effects of UV radiation and higher predation risk, while their predation successes are lessened, in comparison to dark-coloured rockfishes. Overall, this study emphasizes the intricate relationship between genetics, environment, adaptation, and the striking diversity of body colourations observed in Sebastes rockfishes.",

Tagged fish were found in the intertidal zone and adjacent subtidal zones, which were shallower than 12 m, and within 170 m off the coastline. The mean daily movement distance and 95% kernel utilized density of tagged fish were 191 +/- 272 m and 60,207 +/- 99,437 m(2), respectively. The swimming depth of the tagged fish was 1-4 m above the seafloor.

The presence of putative morphological hybrids (PMH) with plausibly higher fitness than the parent species indicates the need to confirm whether hybridization occurs within the complex. In this sense, we assessed the dynamics of genetic divergence and hybridization within the species complex using a panel of 10 microsatellite loci, and sequences of the mitochondrial control region (D-loop) and the intron-free rhodopsin (RH1) gene. The analyses revealed the presence of three distinct genetic clusters, large genetic distances using D-loop sequences, and distinctive mutations within the RH1 gene. These results are consistent with the descriptions of the three species. Two microsatellite loci had signatures of divergent selection, indicating that they are linked to genomic regions that are crucial for speciation. Furthermore, nonsynonymous mutations within the RH1 gene detected in S. cheni and \"Kumano\" (a PMH) suggest dissimilar adaptations related to visual perception in dim-light environments. The presence of individuals with admixed ancestry between two species confirmed hybridization. The presence of nonsynonymous mutations within the RH1 gene and the admixed ancestry of the \"Kumano\" morphotype highlight the potential role of hybridization in generating novelties within the species complex. We discuss possible outcomes of hybridization within the species complex, considering hybrid fitness and assortative mating. Overall, our findings indicate that the genetic divergence of each species is maintained in the presence of hybridization, as expected in a scenario of speciationwith-gene-flow.",

Both ecological parameters exert selective pressures in colouration, communication systems, body, otolith shape, and prey-predation interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that ecomorphological divergences found in these components can reflect reduced interspecific competition among three rockfishes from the same species complex with sympatric occurrence in Seto Inland Sea (Japan). The narrower body shape and golden-brown colouration in Sebastes cheni suggest a more pelagic lifestyle than the other two species. Larger eye and otolith relative sizes, deeper body shape and red colouration suggest a deeper distribution for Sebastes inermis, in concordance with longer pectoral fins and dorsal spines to deal with increased foraging difficulty and predation risk because of its colouration. Meanwhile, smaller upper jaws, higher number of gill rakers, and black colouration of Sebastes ventricosus indicate a shallower distribution than S. inermis and preference for planktonic preys. Differences in colouration, eye size, and otolith descriptors support species-specific communication systems that are crucial to maintaining reproductive isolation. Therefore, the morphological divergences among these rockfishes reflect specific ecological divergences that allow their coexistence in sympatry and can ease their morphological identification.",

Its main final host is the Japanese halfbeak, Hyporhamphus sajori. However, M. parvostis also infests the black sea bream, Acanthopagrus schelgelii, as an optional intermediate host. Understanding the use of optional intermediate hosts is important for understanding the life history of Cymothoidae, and further information should be obtained. In this study, we aim to investigate the life cycle of M. parvostis. We collected and examined 20 mancae and 144 juveniles of M. parvostis from 129 cobaltcap silversides, Hypoatherina tsurugae, and 494 yellowfin seabreams, Acanthopagrus latus. Molecular analysis of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and 16S rRNA genes revealed that cymothoid mancae and juveniles from the two fish species were identified to be M. parvostis. All M. parvostis on H. tsurugae and A. latus might be mancae or juveniles, with no adult parasites; thus, H. tsurugae and A. latus juveniles were optional intermediate hosts of M. parvostis. In the results of morphological description, M. parvostis juveniles infesting the final host H. sajori lacked swimming setae, while juveniles parasitizing the two optional intermediate hosts had them. Mothocya parvostis mancae infested juveniles of both species just after metamorphosis, grew with the host. As the fish grows further, the parasite detached from the fish. The parasitic status of M. parvostis in the three optional intermediate hosts indicated that M. parvostis likely reproduced from June to December, and different optional intermediate hosts were used depending on the time of year in Hiroshima Bay. Therefore, a parasitic strategy involving optional intermediate hosts might increase the infestation success of M. parvostis to H. sajori.",

Mothocya parvostis is re-described based on the ovigerous female type and additional materials collected from the host from in and around the type locality. Morphological re-examination of fresh specimens and the type materials together with genetic data show that the M. sajori and M. parvostis are the same species, differing primarily in size, therefore we have placed Mothocya sajori Bruce, 1986 into a junior synonym of Mothocya parvostis Bruce, 1986. Mothocya parvostis is characterized by the following combinations of characters: 1) body slightly to moderately twisted to one side; 2) pereonite 7 posterior margin moderately to deeply recessed; 3) uropodal rami extending to pleotelson posterior margin; and 4) uropod rami bluntly rounded, exopod 1.5 times as long as peduncle. The differences of four morphological features for M. parvostis and M. sajori was quantified. Furthermore, a total of 635 isopods infesting H. sajori were collected from all over Japan to conduct quantitative morphological and molecular sequence analyses (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S rRNA). Although the four quantitative features did not overlap between the two species in type specimens, all quantitative morphological values of newly collected specimens in this study did not display a bimodal distribution. In addition, our molecular analyses found only a single clade for our newly collected specimens in neighbor-joining tree.",

Most research on the reproductive season of Cymothoidae has been done by collecting or monitoring host fish afflicted with cymothoid parasites. However, collecting ecological data on cymothoid species that infest non-commercial or endangered fishes is complex and challenging. We used a quatrefoil light trap to investigate the seasonal change in species composition of cymothoid free-swimming stages in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. We also collected preliminary data for efficient light-trap sampling and showed its effectiveness in cymothoid-related research. From October 2020 to December 2021, 613 cymothoid free-swimming stages were sampled monthly. All obtained individuals were identified as Mothocya parvostis (596), Ceratothoa verrucosa (12), and Ceratothoa carinata (5) by DNA barcoding using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Based on the number of M. parvostis mancae collected each month, M. parvostis was anticipated to reproduce from June to December, with two reproduction peaks each year, and C. verrucosa and C. carinata were expected to reproduce in June, July, and September, and September and October, respectively. In addition, free-swimming juveniles were captured, presumably after they had left their optional intermediate hosts. Furthermore, the most effective time to harvest cymothoids with light traps may be during high tide on the night of the new moon. This study serves as a methodological framework for future research on cymothoids using light traps.",

Within the HCS, the silverside Odontesthes regia is a coastal fish that faces intense harvesting, and physical and oceanographic variability. Here, we evaluated how different processes in the HCS have shaped the spatial and temporal genetic variation of O. regia populations by using 650-bp alignment of the mitochondrial control region and nine microsatellite loci. We found that both DNA markers indicated high genetic diversity, presence of at least two co-distributed genetic groups, and a slight genetic structure shaped by a biogeographic break within the HCS rather than the latitudinal upwelling differences or geographical distances. Demographic history of these groups suggests an allopatric origin and posterior reconnection as the result of historical changes in the HCS. No genetic interannual divergences were found in subsystems with intermittent presence of warm waters, suggesting no significant influence of El Nin tilde o on the genetic variation of O. regia from 2013 to 2018. Despite the inherent disturbances of the HCS, past and recent estimates of effective population sizes showed high values in most populations. Our results provide essential information for the management of O. regia in the HCS. Our study also helps to understand how the spatiotemporal dynamics of the HCS influences the genetic variation of coastal marine fishes.",

Assessing its population structure is essential to ensure its sustainability. In the Northwestern Pacific, historical glacial and interglacial periods during the Pleistocene have shaped the population structure of many coastal marine fishes. However, whether these events affected the population of black sea bream remains unknown. To test this hypothesis and to assess the population structure of black sea bream, we used 1,046 sequences of the mitochondrial control region from individuals collected throughout almost the entire Japanese coastal waters and combined them with 118 sequences from populations distributed in other marginal seas of the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. As in other coastal marine fish with similar distribution, we also found evidence that the glacial refugia on the marginal seas prompted the formation of three lineages in black sea bream. These lineages present signatures of population growth that coincided with the interglacial periods of the Pleistocene. While the origin of Lineages B and C remains unclear, the higher relative frequency of Lineage A in the southernmost location suggests its origin in the South China Sea. The non-significant pairwise Phi ST and AMOVA of Japanese populations and the presence of these three lineages mixed in Japanese waters; strongly suggest that these lineages are homogenized in both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean. Our results indicate that the black sea bream should be managed as a single stock in Japan until the strength of connectivity in contemporary populations is further addressed using non-coding nuclear markers.",

Immature and mature Mothocya individuals can infect both juveniles and adults of H. sajori, while immature Mothocya are known to parasitize juveniles of A. schlegelii; i.e., no Mothocya parasites are found in adult A. schlegelii. The identification of the immature Mothocya parasitizing juveniles of A. schlegelii remains uncertain, because Mothocya species are morphologically identifiable only based on adult females. Also, the biological/ecological relationship between the hosts and parasites has not been studied. Here, we identified the parasites on A. schlegelii as Mothocya parvostis Bruce, 1986 by molecular sequence analyses along with other parasites obtained from H. sajori, the latter being morphologically confirmed by comparison with paratype materials of M. parvostis as well as the similar congener Mothocya sajori Bruce, 1986. The growth rates of the infected A. schlegelii juveniles from June to September in the years 2013-2015 and 2018 were significantly lower than those of the uninfected ones, suggesting a negative effect of the infection on the hosts. Our data on the prevalence and duration of the infection, as well as the body size gain of the hosts and parasites, corroborate a hypothesis that M. parvostis would utilize A. schlegelii as an optional intermediate host before it reaches the final host, H. sajori.",

In such man-made ecosystems, the biological activities of other organisms as well as the physical structures of ATRs could influence nutrient cycling. A pelagic-benthic coupling model expressing both phosphorus and nitrogen cycling was developed to investigate seasonal variation in the associated nutrients and their annual budget in the ATR areas and the entire bay system. The model consists of equations representing all the relevant physical and biological processes. The model reproduced the observed seasonal variations in dissolved inorganic P, ammonium, and nitrate concentrations that were low in spring and summer and high in autumn and winter. The internal regeneration rates of the nutrients were two times higher in the ATRs than in the bay area, so that fish production was predicted to be higher in the ATRs than in the bay area. Considering the inflows from the land and precipitation are quite low, nutrient regeneration is an important source of nutrients for the water in Mitsu Bay. ATR deployment could be an important local nutrient source in an oligotrophic bay, and could increase fish production.",

We developed a food web model to investigate the relative efficacies of these ATR types compared with the bare, sandy seafloor. The model described the material flow through the food webs formed in each ATR type and their potential to increase fisheries production. The model outputs were validated with observational data over three years. The model fit the observed biomass of both prey animals and fish predators. The simulation results highlighted that ATRs, particularly those with additional materials, had two to three times higher feeding flow than the sandy seafloor and resulted in increased fish biomass. Fish catch doubled in the ATR areas compared to the bare seafloor.

                        "en": "With the aim of simultaneously improving fishery production and utilizing forestry and oyster fishery wastes, three types of artificial timber reefs (ATRs)-constructed from simple timbers, timbers with oyster shells from local oyster farms, and timbers with leaves/branches from forest thinning-were deployed in Mitsu Bay, Japan. We developed a food web model to investigate the relative efficacies of these ATR types compared with the bare, sandy seafloor. The model described the material flow through the food webs formed in each ATR type and their potential to increase fisheries production. The model outputs were validated with observational data over three years. The model fit the observed biomass of both prey animals and fish predators. The simulation results highlighted that ATRs, particularly those with additional materials, had two to three times higher feeding flow than the sandy seafloor and resulted in increased fish biomass. Fish catch doubled in the ATR areas compared to the bare seafloor. Aside from providing a feeding ground, the complexity of the ATRs with additional materials likely acts to provide shelter for juvenile fish. ATR deployment using by-products such as those mentioned above may not only enhance fish stock but also help foster the establishment of a recycling-oriented society."

Here, we present the results of phylogenetic inference at the genus level using mitochondrial and nuclear marker sequences available from public databases. Topologies are presented which show support for (1) the monophyly of the two main superorders, Octobrachia and Decabrachia, and (2) some of the interrelationships at the family level. We have mapped morphological characters onto the tree and conducted molecular dating analyses, obtaining congruent results with previous estimates of divergence in major",
