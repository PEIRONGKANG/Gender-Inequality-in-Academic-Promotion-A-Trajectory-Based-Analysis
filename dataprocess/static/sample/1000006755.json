                        "en": "Glutathione (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) is physiologically synthesized through two ATP-dependent reactions catalyzed by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase and glutathione synthase. The present study was designed to produce glutathione without the aid of ATP by using glutathione-degrading enzymes, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and aminopeptidase M, in reverse: intrinsically the former enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of glutathione to give L-cysteinylglycine and a gamma-glutamyl moiety and the latter hydrolyzes the peptide linkage of L-cysteinylglycine. Both enzymes were simultaneously displayed on proteoliposomes, which were reconstituted from bovine kidney brush border membranes by a cholate dialysis method. The kinetic analysis using artificial substrates, L-gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and L-leucine-p-nitroanilide for aminopeptidase M, revealed that the proteoliposome reconstitution significantly increased the enzyme activities: for both the enzymes the maximum reaction rates were increased and Michaelis constants with the respective substrates were decreased. When the proteoliposomes were incubated with the amino acids glycine, L-cysteine, and L-glutamate (or L-glutamine) at 37degreesC, a new product was determined on HPLC analyses using ODS and cation-exchange columns, coinciding in retention time with authentic glutathione. This product was identified to be glutathione by LC-MS and H-1-NMR, after being purified by gel filtration using Sephadex G10 and HSKgel Toyopearl HW-40F in succession. When the incubation mixture contained acivicin and bestatin, specific inhibitors for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and aminopeptidase M,, respectively, glutathione was not produced at all. These results indicated that glutathione was produced by two-step reversible reactions of aminopeptidase ML and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase from its constituent amino acids. The equilibrium glutathione concentration obtained with L-glutamine as a glutamyl donor substrate was about 3.5 times higher than that obtained with L-glutamate. The maximum pH for the glutathione production was 7.0-7.5, reflecting pH dependence of the activities of the enzymes. (C) 2004 Society of Chemical Industry."

                        "en": "Glutathione (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) is physiologically synthesized through two ATP-dependent reactions catalyzed by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase and glutathione synthase. The present study was designed to produce glutathione without the aid of ATP by using glutathione-degrading enzymes, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and aminopeptidase M, in reverse: intrinsically the former enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of glutathione to give L-cysteinylglycine and a gamma-glutamyl moiety and the latter hydrolyzes the peptide linkage of L-cysteinylglycine. Both enzymes were simultaneously displayed on proteoliposomes, which were reconstituted from bovine kidney brush border membranes by a cholate dialysis method. The kinetic analysis using artificial substrates, L-gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and L-leucine-p-nitroanilide for aminopeptidase M, revealed that the proteoliposome reconstitution significantly increased the enzyme activities: for both the enzymes the maximum reaction rates were increased and Michaelis constants with the respective substrates were decreased. When the proteoliposomes were incubated with the amino acids glycine, L-cysteine, and L-glutamate (or L-glutamine) at 37degreesC, a new product was determined on HPLC analyses using ODS and cation-exchange columns, coinciding in retention time with authentic glutathione. This product was identified to be glutathione by LC-MS and H-1-NMR, after being purified by gel filtration using Sephadex G10 and HSKgel Toyopearl HW-40F in succession. When the incubation mixture contained acivicin and bestatin, specific inhibitors for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and aminopeptidase M,, respectively, glutathione was not produced at all. These results indicated that glutathione was produced by two-step reversible reactions of aminopeptidase ML and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase from its constituent amino acids. The equilibrium glutathione concentration obtained with L-glutamine as a glutamyl donor substrate was about 3.5 times higher than that obtained with L-glutamate. The maximum pH for the glutathione production was 7.0-7.5, reflecting pH dependence of the activities of the enzymes. (C) 2004 Society of Chemical Industry."

In the experiments with a single component system, the rejection of NTR-7450 membrane for the electrolytes corresponded well to the ratio of their anionic species varying with pH. Difference in the rejection between glutathione and some amino acids was maximal in the neutral pH region: at pH 7.4, the rejection for glutathione and L-glutamate was almost 100%, whereas that for L-Cysteine, glycine, and L-glutamine was below 30%. In the presence of divalent metal ions, the rejection for glutathione and L-glutamate decreased with increasing the metal concentration, probably due to partial neutralization of negative charges of the electrolytes forming complexes with the metal ions. In the experiments with a multi-component system, glutathione was completely blocked again by the membrane in a range of glutathione concentration from 0.1 to 5.0 mM in the presence of 1.0, 2.0, or 5.0 mM each of L-glutamine, glycine, and L-Cysteine.

The cross-linking of alginate matrix decreased the mean bead diameter by about 30% and made the beads durable in some extent under alkaline conditions. The adsorption of metal ions on the covalently crosslinked alginate gel beads was rapid and reached at equilibrium within 30 min at 25 degreesC. Adsorption isotherms of Cu(II), Mn(II), and Ca2+ on the beads possessed a stepwise shape, which was firstly determined by Rorrer et al. [Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 32 (1993) 2170] for cross-linked chitosan gel beads and explained by a pore-blockage mechanism. Higher selectivity was determined against Cu(II) over Mn(II) and Ca2+, especially at a low concentration region. These metal adsorption profiles for the covalently cross-linked alginate gel beads was almost the same as those for the un-crosslinked beads, indicating that the cross-linking reactions were performed without interfering the adsorption characteristics of alginate gel beads.

                        "en": "The covalently cross-linked alginate gel beads were prepared by the reactions of Ca2+-doped alginate gel beads, which were formed by spraying a viscous alginate solution into a calcium chloride solution, with cyanogen bromide and following 1,6-diaminohexane. The cross-linking of alginate matrix decreased the mean bead diameter by about 30% and made the beads durable in some extent under alkaline conditions. The adsorption of metal ions on the covalently crosslinked alginate gel beads was rapid and reached at equilibrium within 30 min at 25 degreesC. Adsorption isotherms of Cu(II), Mn(II), and Ca2+ on the beads possessed a stepwise shape, which was firstly determined by Rorrer et al. [Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 32 (1993) 2170] for cross-linked chitosan gel beads and explained by a pore-blockage mechanism. Higher selectivity was determined against Cu(II) over Mn(II) and Ca2+, especially at a low concentration region. These metal adsorption profiles for the covalently cross-linked alginate gel beads was almost the same as those for the un-crosslinked beads, indicating that the cross-linking reactions were performed without interfering the adsorption characteristics of alginate gel beads.

The specific oxygen consumption rate, q, of Sf-9 was scarcely changed with cell density and growth phases except for stationary phase. However, the q was varied with dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and described by a Monod-form equation in the range of 20-34 degreesC. For uninfected Sf-9, the maximum specific oxygen consumption rate, q(max), in the equation decreased with decreasing temperature, whereas the saturation constant, K-S, remained constant independent of temperature up to 28 degreesC, at which Sf-9 cultures were usually performed. This indicated that the cellular physiology of Sf-9 was not altered in the temperature region. On a viral infection, the q(max), increased by 30-40% irrespective of temperature, and the K-S increased more largely at higher temperature.\nThe virus-infected Sf-9 culture was performed at 20 and 28 degreesC using a 21 spinner flask with a working volume of 11, and DO behavior and recombinant protein production were determined. The oxygenation was done by supplying only air to mimic a large-scale culture of oxygenation-limited conditions. As a result, only the 20 degreesC culture was successful to keep DO concentration above the critical DO concentration (3K(S)) and produce a large amount of green fluorescent protein, a recombinant model protein, but not the 28 degreesC culture. The DO behavior in both the 20 and 28 degreesC cultures was well simulated by model calculation using the oxygen consumption parameters obtained above. These results indicated that a low temperature culture was useful to circumvent oxygen starvation of virus-infected Sf-9 cells and to successfully produce recombinant proteins. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, only the 20 degreesC culture was successful to keep DO concentration above the critical DO concentration (3K(S)) and produce a large amount of green fluorescent protein, a recombinant model protein, but not the 28 degreesC culture. The DO behavior in both the 20 and 28 degreesC cultures was well simulated by model calculation using the oxygen consumption parameters obtained above. These results indicated that a low temperature culture was useful to circumvent oxygen starvation of virus-infected Sf-9 cells and to successfully produce recombinant proteins. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.
