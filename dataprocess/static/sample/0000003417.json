                        "en": "Melanins are the main pigments found in mammals. Their synthesis and transfer to keratinocytes have been widely investigated for many years. However, analysis has been mainly carried out using fixed rather than live cells. In this study, we have analysed the melanosomes in living mammalian cells using newly developed scanning electron-assisted dielectric microscopy (SE-ADM). The melanosomes in human melanoma MNT-1 cells were observed as clear black particles in SE-ADM. The main structure of melanosomes was toroidal while that of normal melanocytes was ellipsoidal. In tyrosinase knockout MNT-1 cells, not only the black particles in the SE-ADM images but also the Raman shift of melanin peaks completely disappeared suggesting that the black particles were really melanosomes. We developed a deep neural network (DNN) system to automatically detect melanosomes in cells and analysed their diameter and roundness. In terms of melanosome morphology, the diameter of melanosomes in melanoma cells did not change while that in normal melanocytes increased during culture. The established DNN analysis system with SE-ADM can be used for other particles, e.g. exosomes, lysosomes, and other biological particles."

                        "en": "Autophagy is an intracellular self-devouring system that plays a central role in cellular recycling. The formation of functional autophagosomes depends on several autophagy-related proteins, including the microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) and the conserved autophagy-related gene 12 (Atg12). We have recently developed a novel scanning electron-assisted dielectric microscope (SE-ADM) for nanoscale observations of intact cells. Here, we used the SE-ADM system to observe LC3- and Atg12-containing autophagosomes in cells labelled in the culture medium with antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold particles. We observed that, during autophagosome formation, Atg12 localized along the actin meshwork structure, whereas LC3 formed arcuate or circular alignments. Our system also showed a difference in the distribution of LC3 and Atg12; Atg12 was broadly distributed while LC3 was more localized. The difference in the spatial distribution demonstrated by our system explains the difference in the size of fluorescent spots due to the fluorescently labelled antibodies observed using optical microscopy. The direct SE-ADM observation of cells should thus be effective in analyses of autophagosome formation."

                        "en": "Cancer therapy is often hampered by the disease's development of resistance to anticancer drugs. We previously showed that the autonomously upregulated product of fibroblast growth factor 13 gene (FGF13; also known as FGF homologous factor 2 (FHF2)) is responsible for the cisplatin resistance of HeLa cisR cells and that it is likely responsible for the poor prognosis of cervical cancer patients treated with cisplatin. Here we show that cloperastine and two other histamine H1 receptor antagonists selectively kill HeLa cisR cells at concentrations that little affect parental HeLa S cells. The sensitivity of HeLa cisR cells to cloperastine was abolished by knocking down FGF13 expression. Cisplatin-resistant A549 cisR cells were similarly susceptible to cloperastine. H2, H3, and H4 receptor antagonists showed less or no cytotoxicity toward HeLa cisR or A549 cisR cells. These results indicate that histamine H1 receptor antagonists selectively kill cisplatin-resistant human cancer cells and suggest that this effect is exerted through a molecular mechanism involving autocrine histamine activity and high-level expression of FGF13. We think this represents a potential opportunity to utilize H1 receptor antagonists in combination with anticancer agents to treat cancers in which emergent drug-resistance is preventing effective treatment."

Recently, we developed a novel imaging technology, scanning electron-assisted dielectric-impedance microscopy (SE-ADM), which enables observation of various biological specimens in aqueous solution. In this study, we successfully observed PM2.5 incorporated into living mammalian cells in culture media. Our system directly revealed the process of PM2.5 aggregation in the cells at a nanometre resolution. Further, we found that the PM2.5 aggregates in the intact cells were surrounded by intracellular membrane-like structures of low-density in the SE-ADM images. Moreover, the PM2.5 aggregates were shown by confocal Raman microscopy to be located inside the cells rather than on the cell surface. We expect our method to be applicable to the observation of various nanoparticles inside cells in culture media."

                        "en": "The contribution of secretions from tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-like cells to the stimulation of mechanical property changes in murine breast cancer cells was studied using an in vitro model system. A murine breast cancer cell line (FP10SC2) was stimulated by adding macrophage (J774.2) cultivation medium containing stimulation molecules secreted from the macrophages, and changes in mechanical properties were compared before and after stimulation. As a result, cell elasticity decreased, degradation ability of the extracellular matrix increased, and the expression of plakoglobin was upregulated. These results indicate that cancer cell malignancy is upregulated by this stimulation. Moreover, changes in intercellular adhesion strengths between pairs of cancer cells were measured before and after stimulation using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The maximum force required to separate cells was increased by stimulation with the secreted factors. These results indicate the possibility that TAMs cause changes in the mechanical properties of cancer cells in tumor microenvironments, and in vitro measurements of mechanical property changes in cancer cells will be useful to study interactions between cells in tumor microenvironments."

The cup-attached chip was used to approach a cell, pick it up, and then approach another cell, and the adhesion strengths were measured according to the contact time of the cells between 0 to 60 s. Separation work was used as a parameter for quantitative comparisons of the strengths. As a result, the work of a highly metastatic cancer cell (FP10SC2) was greater than a low metastatic cancer cell (4T1-LM) throughout all contact times examined. Adhesion was analyzed from a point of a view of binding kinetics of receptors on cells, and two possibilities were found: one was the number of cell adhesive receptors increased, and the other was the work to separate single molecular binding increased with increasing cancer cell malignancy. These results indicated quantitative measurements of intercellular adhesion strengths using AFM yielded information to understand the mechanism of the cancer progression from a new perspective."

                        "en": "Mineralization is the most fundamental process in vertebrates. It is predominantly mediated by osteoblasts, which secrete mineral precursors, most likely through matrix vesicles (MVs). These vesicular structures are calcium and phosphate rich and contain organic material such as acidic proteins. However, it remains largely unknown how intracellular MVs are transported and secreted. Here, we use scanning electron-assisted dielectric microscopy and super-resolution microscopy for assessing live osteoblasts in mineralizing conditions at a nanolevel resolution. We found that the calcium-containing vesicles were multivesicular bodies containing MVs. They were transported via lysosome and secreted by exocytosis. Thus, we present proof that the lysosome transports amorphous calcium phosphate within mineralizing osteoblasts."

The largest integrin subgroup is integrin β1, which contributes to several malignant phenotypes. Recently, we have developed a novel imaging technology named scanning electron-assisted dielectric-impedance microscopy (SE-ADM), which visualizes untreated living mammalian cells in aqueous conditions with high contrast. Using the SE-ADM system, we observed 60-nm gold colloids with antibodies directly binding to the focal adhesion core containing integrin β1 on mammalian cancer cells without staining and fixation. The adhesion core contains three or four high-density regions of integrin β1 and connects to the actin filament. An adhesion core with high-density integrin β1 is suggested to contain 10-20 integrin dimers. Our SE-ADM system can also visualize various other membrane proteins in living cells in medium without staining and fixation."

In particular, milk-casein micelles have been used as drug nanocarriers for targeting cancer cells. Therefore, nanostructure observation of particles and micelles in their native liquid condition is indispensable for analysing their function and mechanisms. However, traditional optical and scanning electron microscopy have difficulty observing the nanostructures of aqueous micelles. Recently, we developed a novel imaging technique called scanning electron-assisted dielectric microscopy (SE-ADM) that enables observation of various biological specimens in water with very little radiation damage and high-contrast imaging without staining or fixation at an 8-nm spatial resolution. In this study, for the first time, we show that the SE-ADM system is capable of high-resolution observation of whole-milk specimens in their natural state. Moreover, we successfully observe the casein micelles and milk-fat globules in an intact liquid condition. Our SE-ADM system can be applied to various biological particles and micelles in a native liquid state."

                        "en": "Intercellular adhesion between a macrophage and cancer cells was quantitatively measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Cup-shaped metal hemispheres were fabricated using polystyrene particles as a template, and a cup was attached to the apex of the AFM cantilever. The cup-attached AFM chip (cup chip) approached a murine macrophage cell (J774.2), the cell was captured on the inner concave of the cup, and picked up by withdrawing the cup-chip from the substrate. The cell-attached chip was advanced towards a murine breast cancer cell (FP10SC2), and intercellular adhesion between the two cells was quantitatively measured. To compare cell adhesion strength, the work required to separate two adhered cells (separation work) was used as a parameter. Separation work was almost 2-fold larger between a J774.2 cell and FP10SC2 cell than between J774.2 cell and three additional different cancer cells (4T1E, MAT-LyLu, and U-2OS), two FP10SC2 cells, or two J774.2 cells. FP10SC2 was established from 4T1E as a highly metastatic cell line, indicates separation work increased as the malignancy of cancer cells became higher. One possible explanation of the strong adhesion of macrophages to cancer cells observed in this study is that the measurement condition mimicked the microenvironment of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in vivo, and J774.2 cells strongly expressed CD204, which is a marker of TAMs. The results of the present study, which were obtained by measuring cell adhesion strength quantitatively, indicate that the fabricated cup-chip is a useful tool for measuring intercellular adhesion easily and quantitatively.

                        "en": "Understanding tumor heterogeneity is an urgent and unmet need in cancer research. In this study, we used a morphology-based optical cell separation process to classify a heterogeneous cancer cell population into characteristic subpopulations. To classify the cell subpopulations, we assessed their morphology in hydrogel, a three-dimensional culture environment that induces morphological changes according to the characteristics of the cells (i.e., growth, migration, and invasion). We encapsulated the murine breast cancer cell line 4T1E, as a heterogeneous population that includes highly metastatic cells, in click-crosslinkable and photodegradable gelatin hydrogels, which we developed previously. We observed morphological changes within 3 days of encapsulating the cells in the hydrogel. We separated the 4T1E cell population into colony-and granular-type cells by optical separation, in which local UVinduced degradation of the photodegradable hydrogel around the target cells enabled us to collect those cells. The obtained colony-and granular-type cells were evaluated in vitro by using a spheroid assay and in vivo by means of a tumor growth and metastasis assay. The spheroid assay showed that the colony-type cells formed compact spheroids in 2 days, whereas the granular-type cells did not form spheroids. The tumor growth assay in mice revealed that the granular-type cells exhibited lower tumor growth and a different metastasis behavior compared with the colony-type cells. These results suggest that morphology-based optical cell separation is a useful technique to classify a heterogeneous cancer cell population according to its cellular characteristics."

                        "en": "Nanometre-scale-resolution imaging technologies for liquid-phase specimens are indispensable tools in various scientific fields. In biology, observing untreated living cells in a medium is essential for analysing cellular functions. However, nanoparticles that bind living cells in a medium are hard to detect directly using traditional optical or electron microscopy. Therefore, we previously developed a novel scanning electron-assisted dielectric microscope (SE-ADM) capable of nanoscale observations. This method enables observation of intact cells in aqueous conditions. Here, we use this SE-ADM system to clearly observe antibody-binding nanobeads in liquid-phase. We also report the successful direct detection of streptavidin-conjugated nanobeads binding to untreated cells in a medium via a biotin-conjugated anti-CD44 antibody. Our system is capable of obtaining clear images of cellular organelles and beads on the cells at the same time. The direct observation of living cells with nanoparticles in a medium allowed by our system may contribute the development of carriers for drug delivery systems (DDS)."

                        "en": "The physiological activities of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), a component of fiber-type cannabis plants, have been demonstrated and include its function as a protector against external invasion by inducing cannabinoid-mediated necrosis (Shoyama et al., Plant Signal Behav 3:1111-1112, 2008). The biological activities of CBDA have been attracting increasing attention. We previously identified CBDA as an inhibitor of the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, a widely used human breast cancer cell line in cancer biology, due to its highly aggressive nature. The chemical inhibition and down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the expression of which has been detected in ~40 % of human invasive breast cancers, are suggested to be involved in the CBDA-mediated abrogation of cell migration. However, the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the CBDA-induced down-regulation of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we describe a possible mechanism by which CBDA abrogates the expression of COX-2 via the selective down-regulation of c-fos, one component of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) dimer complex, a transcription factor for the positive regulation of the COX-2 gene."

                        "en": "We previously established 4T1E/M3 highly bone marrow metastatic mouse breast cancer cells through in vivo selection of 4T1 cells. But while the incidence of bone marrow metastasis of 4T1E/M3 cells was high (~80%) when injected intravenously to mice, it was rather low (~20%) when injected subcutaneously. Therefore, using 4T1E/M3 cells, we carried out further in vitro and in vivo selection steps to establish FP10SC2 cells, which show a very high incidence of metastasis to lungs (100%) and spines (85%) after subcutaneous injection into mice. qRT-PCR and western bolt analysis revealed that cadherin-17 gene and protein expression were higher in FP10SC2 cells than in parental 4T1E/M3 cells. In addition, immunostaining revealed the presence of cadherin-17 at sites of bone marrow and lung metastasis after subcutaneous injection of FP10SC2 cells into mice. Suppressing cadherin-17 expression in FP10SC2 cells using RNAi dramatically decreased the cells' anchorage-independent growth and migration in vitro and their metastasis to lung and bone marrow in vivo. These findings suggest that cadherin-17 plays a crucial role in mediating breast cancer metastasis to bone marrow."

                        "en": "Imaging of untreated living cells in a medium at a nanometre-scale resolution under physiological conditions is a significant challenge. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is widely used to observe cells in various atmospheric holders or special equipment. However, untreated biological specimens in aqueous solution generally incur heavy radiation damage from the direct electron beam (EB); and these images exhibit very poor contrast. Therefore, a new method for generating high-contrast images of living cells under physiological conditions without radiation damage has been strongly desired. Here, we demonstrate the first nanoscale observation of living cultured mammalian cells using our newly developed scanning-electron assisted dielectric microscopy (SE-ADM) method with a culture dish holder. Using the difference in relative permittivity between water and specimens, our SE-ADM system aids in the visualisation of untreated biological samples in aqueous solution. In addition, specimens incurred only a low level of radiation damage because the tungsten (W)-coated silicon nitride (SiN) film absorbs irradiated electrons. Untreated cells and organelles are clearly visible in high-contrast and high-resolution images without staining and fixation. Furthermore, our method enables the detection of changes in organelle structures within cells via time-lapse imaging with minimal radiation damage."

Thus, the time-consuming pretreatments generally required for biological samples to withstand the vacuum of a standard electron microscope are avoided. In the present study, various mouse tissues (brain, spinal cord, muscle, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and stomach) were fixed, stained with heavy metals, and visualized in radical scavenger D-glucose solution using the ASEM. While some stains made the nuclei of cells very prominent (platinum-blue, phosphotungstic acid), others also emphasized cell organelles and membranous structures (uranium acetate or the NCMIR method). Notably, symbiotic bacteria were sometimes observed on stomach mucosa. Furthermore, kidney tissue could be stained and successfully imaged in <30 min. Lung and spinal cord tissue from normal mice and mice metastasized with breast cancer cells was also examined. Cancer cells present in lung alveoli and in parts of the spine tissue clearly had larger nuclei than normal cells. The results indicate that the ASEM has the potential to accelerate intraoperative cancer diagnosis, the diagnosis of kidney diseases and pathogen detection. Importantly, in the course of the present study it was possible to increase the observable tissue area by using a new multi-windowed ASEM sample dish and sliding the tissue across its eight windows."

The correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM) of a sample in liquid is highly required to determine their localization at high resolution. To realize electron microscopy in solution, environmental-capsule electron microscopy (EC-EM) has been developed. However, the limited space around the sample holder of standard TEM, preclude the simultaneous observation using OM with high resolution objective lens of large NA. We have developed atmospheric scanning electron microscopy (ASEM) with inverted SEM to allow the use of an open sample container sandwiched by OM and SEM. In this research, we have tested many fluorescent substances, including GFP, qDot and ZnO. Further the markers tested here should be exploited for the application to various biological fields including basic biology, medical research, agriculture, drug discovery and diagnosis."

We demonstrate the nanoscale observation of living cultured mammalian cells using SE-ADM system with a newly developed culture dish holder. As a result, intact cells and organelles are clearly visible in high-contrast and high-resolution images in medium. Moreover, we successfully observe nanobeads directly binding to living cancer cells via anti-CD44 antibody in a medium and their intracellular structure at the same time.

Cancer cells are co-cultured with both ALA and HP, thereafter the cells are injected to mice. Spectrometric analyses of the CTCs demonstrate that cancer cells emit porphyrin fluorescence. Whole blood is analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) after a hemato cellular lytic treatment to find CTCs with porphyrin fluorescence. We have reported that reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved a cancer cellular specific porphyrin fluorescence, and indomethacin (IND), a NSAID accelerated mitochondrial ROS. Thus we elucidate whether ROS induced by IND treatment accelerates cancer cellular porphyrin fluorescence. IND treatment enhances cancer cellular specific ROS to involve porphyrin fluorescence acceleration. Thus we conclude that IND pretreatment can be a clue to detect CTCs."

We investigated properties of three DNA-binding domains by isothermal titration calorimetry and found that only one of them (CUTr1) is responsible for the sequence-specific DNA binding. By introducing phosphorothioate modification, we obtained a high-affinity nucleic acid especially under salt concentration close to biological condition. Crystal structure of complex of this nucleic acid and CUTr1 revealed that hydrophobic interactions between phosphorothioate and amino acid side chain are responsible for the high affinity."
