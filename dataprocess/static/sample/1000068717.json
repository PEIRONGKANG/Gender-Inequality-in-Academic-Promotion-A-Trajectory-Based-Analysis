                        "en": "Objective Supracricoid laryngectomy (SCL) with Cricohyoidoepiglotto-pexy (CHEP) or Cricohyoido-pexy (CHP) is an organ preservation surgery indicated for early and selected advanced laryngeal cancers. To verify the clinical usefulness of supracricoid laryngectomy versus total laryngectomy, a retrospective review was conducted.\nMethods We summarized the clinical and postoperative data of 32 patients who received SCL over the past 9 years (1997-2005). Five-year survival rate of the SCL patient group (29 cases) was compared with that of the patient group receiving total laryngectomy (35 cases) within the same period.\nResults Wound infection was detected in 12 patients (38%). Those with severe infection, which required surgical intervention, included two cases of ruptured pexis and two cases showing cricoid cartilage necrosis induced by Forestier disease. There were two T4 cases that resulted in extensive excision. In one case, excision involved the posterior part of the cricoid cartilage resulting in insufficient closure of the neoglottis; the patient received total laryngectomy 30 months after SCL-CHEP because of persistent aspiration of liquid diet. In the other T4 case, the tumor invaded the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages but not the cricoid cartilage. Reposition of the remaining corniculate cartilage resulted in sufficient closure of the neoglottis; this patient subsequently acquired satisfactory laryngeal function. The 5-year overall survival rate was 86% for SCL group and 61% for the total laryngectomy group (limited to Stages III and IV glottic cancers). The causes of the four deaths were distant metastasis, neck metastasis, and intercurrent disease, respectively. Two patients are alive with distant disease.\nConclusion Through our experience in this series, the functional and oncological results of SCL showed certain advantages over those of total laryngectomy. Particularly, the clinical impact of SCL-CHEP was impressive; this technique needs is recommended to both head and neck surgeons and patients. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Objective Supracricoid laryngectomy (SCL) with Cricohyoidoepiglotto-pexy (CHEP) or Cricohyoido-pexy (CHP) is an organ preservation surgery indicated for early and selected advanced laryngeal cancers. To verify the clinical usefulness of supracricoid laryngectomy versus total laryngectomy, a retrospective review was conducted.\nMethods We summarized the clinical and postoperative data of 32 patients who received SCL over the past 9 years (1997-2005). Five-year survival rate of the SCL patient group (29 cases) was compared with that of the patient group receiving total laryngectomy (35 cases) within the same period.\nResults Wound infection was detected in 12 patients (38%). Those with severe infection, which required surgical intervention, included two cases of ruptured pexis and two cases showing cricoid cartilage necrosis induced by Forestier disease. There were two T4 cases that resulted in extensive excision. In one case, excision involved the posterior part of the cricoid cartilage resulting in insufficient closure of the neoglottis; the patient received total laryngectomy 30 months after SCL-CHEP because of persistent aspiration of liquid diet. In the other T4 case, the tumor invaded the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages but not the cricoid cartilage. Reposition of the remaining corniculate cartilage resulted in sufficient closure of the neoglottis; this patient subsequently acquired satisfactory laryngeal function. The 5-year overall survival rate was 86% for SCL group and 61% for the total laryngectomy group (limited to Stages III and IV glottic cancers). The causes of the four deaths were distant metastasis, neck metastasis, and intercurrent disease, respectively. Two patients are alive with distant disease.\nConclusion Through our experience in this series, the functional and oncological results of SCL showed certain advantages over those of total laryngectomy. Particularly, the clinical impact of SCL-CHEP was impressive; this technique needs is recommended to both head and neck surgeons and patients. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of benign and malignant tumors and cysts in the upper airway in patients who snore.\nMethods: A retrospective multicenter trial was performed in 4 sleep laboratories. Adult male and female patients whose chief complaint on their first visit was witnessed snoring were enrolled in this study. All of the patients were evaluated by otolaryngologists using nasopharyngeal endoscopy to detect organic diseases in the upper airway.\nResults: Among 2,923 patients, 2 patients had malignant tumors, 5 had benign tumors, and 2 had cysts in the upper airway. The prevalence of upper airway benign and malignant tumors and cysts among adult male and female patients was 0.24%.\nConclusions: Routine detailed nasopharyngeal endoscopy should be carried out in each institution so as not to overlook organic diseases in the upper airway among patients who snore."

                        "en": "The aim of this retrospective study was to compare concurrent radiation therapy (RT) combined with peroral chemotherapy (UFT or TS-1) with conventional RT for T2NO glottic cancer. Between 1974 and 2005, 153 patients with T2NO glottic cancer were treated with radiation alone or radiation combined with peroral (UFT or TS-1) or intravenous chemotherapy. All except one patient were treated with 2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions per week, totaling 60 Gy; and the remaining patient was treated with 1.8 Gy perfraction, 5 fractions per week totaling 61.2 Gy. Eighty-three patients were concurrently given UFT, 24 were given TS-1, 23 intravenous chemotherapy (mainly cisplatin; the Pt Group), and 23 had no chemotherapy. The 5-year local control rate was 83.4%. Stratified by RT alone (the RT group) and concurrent chemoradiation therapy (the CCRT group), 5-year local control rates of the RT and CCRT groups were 82.7% and 83.4%, respectively (p=NS). Stratified by chemotherapy regimens of the CCRT group, 3-year local control rates of the UFT, TS-1 and Pt groups were 90.1 %, 100.0% and 73.4%, respectively. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy using UFT or TS-1 for T2NO glottic cancer is one of the standard treatments in Japan. Concur-rent use of TS-1 could be a breakthrough treatment for T2NO glottic cancer."

We successfully removed the lesions using laser assisted with NBI combined with magnifying GIE. Because NBI combined with magnifying GIE shows a well-demarcated brownish area and scattered foci of microvascular proliferation, it may play an important role in the management of superficial squamous cell carcinoma in the oral cavity."

We successfully removed the lesions using laser assisted with NBI combined with magnifying GIE. Because NBI combined with magnifying GIE shows a well-demarcated brownish area and scattered foci of microvascular proliferation, it may play an important role in the management of superficial squamous cell carcinoma in the oral cavity."

Materials and Methods: In 189 patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis, the color of the inferior turbinate was assessed more than 1 month before, immediately before and during the pollen-scattering season. The severity of the disease was classified according to the Practical Guideline for the Management of Allergic Rhinitis in Japan, 2005. The color was assessed using the XYZ colorimetric reference system. Statistical analysis was performed with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: The color of the inferior turbinate mucosa differed significantly depending on the severity of symptoms and time of measurement, and was determined by an interaction between the two. The red color element of the inferior turbinate became deeper before the pollen-scattering season in those patients who subsequently developed severe symptoms as compared with those with moderate or mild symptoms. Conclusion: The severity of the pollinosis can be predicted based on the color of the inferior turbinate before the start of the pollen-scattering season. Those patients in whom the red color element of the inferior turbinate became deeper before the onset of the pollen-scattering season are likely to develop severe pollinosis.",
