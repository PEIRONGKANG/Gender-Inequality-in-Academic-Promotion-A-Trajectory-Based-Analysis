                        "en": "[ 1] We have compiled extensive gravity and bathymetry data for the whole Mariana Trough, which were collected during several Japanese scientific cruises over the last few years. This study aims to clarify the lateral distribution of the local differences in geochemical signatures, which have been observed locally in the Mariana Trough. Shipboard free-air gravity anomaly data from eight Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) cruises were compiled with those crossover errors of 2.85 mgal. Mantle Bouguer anomalies (MBA) were calculated by subtracting the predictable gravity signal due to the seawater/crust and crust/mantle density boundaries. The crustal thickness variation along the spreading axis was estimated from the MBA. Different features in crustal thickness, its variation, and segment length for each segment, allow us to identify four distinct regional differences in magmatic activity along the spreading axis of the Mariana Trough. Segment in region A ( to the north of 20 degrees 35'N) shows the largest sectional dimensions of crust along the axis and it is probably affected by an additional supply from island arc magma sources. A variety of crustal thickness values and of along-axis crustal thickness variations in region B ( between 15 degrees 38'N and 20 degrees 35'N) suggests two types of segments. One is similar to a slow spreading ridge segment that has a plume-like mantle upwelling under the spreading axis, and the other is a magma-starved segment. Region C ( between 14 degrees 22'N and 15 degrees 38'N) is a less magmatic region ( individual crustal thickness averages of 3.4 - 4.1 km). Region D ( to the south of 14 degrees 22'N) has higher individual crustal thickness averages of 5.9 - 6.9 km, suggesting higher magmatic activity with a sheet-like mantle upwelling under the spreading axis. Different features in the MBA for off-axis areas suggest that these four regions have existed since the Mariana Trough started spreading. Moreover, comparison between our results of crustal thickness and previous geochemical results indicates that less magmatic spreading segments with thin crust, which are locally distributed in both regions B and C, probably result from mantle source depleted of water and incompatible elements. This suggests that lateral compositional variation of water and incompatible elements exists on a segment scale in the mantle source beneath the spreading axis of the Mariana Trough."

                        "en": "The &lt; 6 Ma young Taitao ophiolite, exposed at the westernmost promontory of the Taitao Peninsula, is located approximately 40 km southeast of the Chile triple junction and consists of a complete sequence of oceanic lithosphere. Systematic sampling for paleomagnetic study was performed to understand the complex obduction processes of the ophiolite onto the forearc of the South American Plate. Two representative demagnetization paths of remanent magnetization vectors were observed. One is characterized by stable univectorial demagnetization paths and was observed in volcaniclastic rocks and dyke complexes. Orientations of their remanent magnetization vectors indicate various degrees of counterclockwise rotations. The other is characterized by multivectorial demagnetization paths and was observed in the plutonic units (gabbros and ultramafic rocks). From these, two distinct stable remanent magnetization vectors were isolated; one has high coercivity and the other has low coercivity along the demagnetization paths with little influence of viscous magnetizations. This suggests that the complex deformation history involved at least two rotational events. The clockwise rotation, inferred from high coercivity remanent magnetization vectors, was attributed to a ridge collision event and the counterclockwise rotation, inferred from the low coercivity remanent magnetization vectors, was attributed to an accommodation phase into the South American forearc during obduction and final emplacement of the ophiolite. Folds developed during this period. Paleomagnetic restorations of the internal structures of the plutonic units and dyke complexes suggest that they probably originated in a mid-oceanic ridge environment near a transform fault. The counterclockwise rotation of the plutonic and dyke complex units during the obduction generated tectonic gaps between these and the basement. The volcaniclastic rocks must have been deposited at nearly their present location, filling the tectonic gaps, as less effect of tectonic rotation was identified on these rocks."

                        "en": "In order to probe anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) characteristics of tide-influenced sediments, AMS analyses and primary sedimentary structure observation and description were conducted on the borehole CM-97 samples from Changjiang delta, China. Primary sedimentary structure (cross-laminations) observation and description were based on a detailed examination of X-ray photographs of samples. Primary cross-laminations were found on 19 of 35 subcores, among which five subcores, A6, A7, B17, B30, and B38, have bidirectional cross-laminations. We found a total of 35 cross-laminations on the subcore sections of tide-influenced sediments, of which 14 were distributed on the five subcores with bidirectional cross-laminations. By their bidirectional dipping foreset laminae, the primary cross-laminations clearly showed bidirectional flow features of the environments in which these sediments formed. Comparing the paleocurrent directions shown by these cross-laminations with those indicated by the in situ AMS data, we found that more than 64% exhibited similar current directions, demonstrating that AMS can supply us with the true paleocurrent directions for such sediments. From the downhole paleocurrent changes inferred from the in situ AMS data, it was also clear that there were bidirectional flows during the deposition of these sediments and that sediments deposited in different environments had different change characteristics with respect to downhole paleocurrents. These differences among the muddy intertidal- to subtidal-flat sediments (unit 5), the Changjiang estuary central basin sediments (unit 6), and the delta front sediments (unit 8) may have resulted from the different hydrodynamic conditions of these sedimentary environments. Furthermore, stratigraphic unit 5 was subdivided into three parts based on downhole AMS characteristics, which may correlate with those subdivided according to downhole paleocurrent changes. Therefore, besides its long recognized role in paleocurrent determination, AMS can also be used to determine stratigraphic divisions and to reconstruct sedimentary paleoenvironments in detail."

                        "en": "A magnetic fabric analysis has been carried out on standard cube samples from one gravity and three multiple cores extracted from the Shiribeshi trough and Okushiri basin in the southern margin of the Japan sea north basin. It is aimed at tracing the flow path of turbidites that are assumed to have deposited in response to the 1993 Hokkaido-Nansei-oki earthquake. Magnetic remanence was used for reorientation to the geographic coordinates. Magnetomineralogical investigations including low-temperature magnetometry, magnetic hysteresis loops and isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition experiments indicate that pseudo-single domain to multidomain magnetite is the principal magnetic carrier and is, therefore, capable of providing reliable anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) palaeocurrent direction estimates. A well-developed near-horizontal magnetic foliation and minimum susceptibility axes lying close to vertical are recorded at all sites reflecting an original depositional fabric. Clearly defined magnetic lineation was observed at all sites and is considered to reflect the palaeocurrent direction. Down-core changes of susceptibility and key AMS parameters show good correspondence to occurrences of turbidite layers marking the increase of input of influx materials. In agreement with results from recent marine surveys and IZANAGI side-scan sonar images, an NNE transportation trend has been estimated for sediments at sites from the Shiribeshi trough with a possible depositing path initiating from the slope bounding the south and southeastern margin down to the trough floor. Similarly, a SSE palaeocurrent direction has been estimated for sediments from the Okushiri basin with evidence for a relatively strong transporting current flowing through the canyons along the steep slope bounding the north and northeastern margins of the basin. The present results agree with the view that slope failure is the most probable mechanism for the down-slope transport of the sand from the shelves and upper slopes down to floors of basins and troughs in the southern margin of the Japan sea north basin. They further support the ongoing assumption that the 1993 Hokkaido-Nansei-oki and other strong historical earthquakes together with associated tsunamis are the principal triggering forces for the down-slope mass gravitational transport and formation of turbidites in this seismically active area."

                        "en": "A rock-magnetic and paleomagnetic study was conducted on a sediment core of about 4.4 m long taken from the northeastern part of the Japan Sea. The core covers the last about 30 kyrs, which was dated by nineteen radiocarbon (C-14) ages. Remanent magnetization is carried dominantly by magnetite. Reductive dissolution of magnetic minerals occurs between 1.2 and 1.6 m in depth (about 5-8 ka in age). A rapid downcore decrease of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) begins at the shallowest depth. Saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) follows, and a decrease of magnetic susceptibility (k) takes place at the deepest. Within this zone, coercivity of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and the ratios of ARM to k and SIRM to k also decreases with depth. These observations indicate that finer magnetic grains were lost earlier than larger grains. A decrease of S ratios, wasp-waisted hysteresis curves, and a deviation from a mixing trend of single-domain and multi-domain grains in a Day plot occur as the dissolution proceeds, which suggests that high coercivity minerals like hematite are more resistive to dissolution than low coercivity minerals like magnetite. The start of the dissolution at 1.2 m in depth is synchronous with increases in organic-carbon and total-sulfur contents, but the horizon does not coincide with the present Fe-redox boundary at about 0.02 m below the sediment-water interface. From low-temperature magnetometry, it is estimated that magnetites with maghemite skin are reduced to pure magnetites prior to dissolution. There is no evidence for precipitation of secondary magnetic phases and acquisition of chemical remanent magnetization (CRM). Neither pyrrhotite nor greigite was detected. Information of paleomagnetic directions have survived the reductive dissolution. Inclination variations of this core resembles closely to the secular variation records available around Japan. Well-dated records older than 10 ka are still very rare, and hence our new record could be useful for establishing regional secular variations."

                        "en": "A paleomagnetic study has been conducted on three gravity cores obtained from the Ontong-Java Plateau (OJP) in the western equatorial Pacific in order to investigate long-term secular variations during the Brunhes Chron. The cores consist of nanofossil foraminiferal ooze, and covers the last 500,000-800,000 years with average sedimentation rates of 6-9 m/m.y. Downcore changes of magnetic concentration represented by magnetic susceptibility are a factor of six or less, and variations in magnetic grain size and mineralogy are estimated to be small from the hysteresis parameters, ratio of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) to saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM), and S ratio. These results indicate that the sediments are rock-magnetically homogeneous in general, and are hence suitable for relative paleointensity estimation. I chose SIRM as a normalizer for relative paleointensity. The three cores could be precisely correlated with each other using relative paleointensity variations. Depth-to-age conversion was carried out by tying to the Sint-800 paleointensity stack (Guyodo and Valet, 1999). The ages are consistent with the oxygen-isotope stratigraphy available for one of the three cores. Inclination variations were obtained after alternating-field demagnetization. Large inclination anomaly, about -7degrees in average, was observed as has been suggested to occur in the western equatorial Pacific by some studies. The inclination records of the three cores were integrated into a single record based on the correlation by the relative paleointensity. Long-term inclination variations of the order of 10,000-100,000 years were recognized. The inclinations tend to deflect toward negative when relative paleointensity is low. The variations are similar in general to the record from the West Caroline Basin (Yamazaki and Oda, 2002), which supports their model that long-term inclination variation is controlled by relative strength of the geocentric axial dipole (GAD) and persistent non-dipole components.

                        "en": "Two dives of the DSV Shinkai 6500 in the Mariana Trough back-arc basin in the western Pacific sampled back-arc basin mantle exposures. Reports of peridotite exposures in back-arc basin setting are very limited and the lack of samples has hindered our understanding of this important aspect of lithospheric evolution. The Mariana Trough is a slow-spreading ridge, and ultramafic exposures with associated gabbro dykes or sills are located within a segment boundary. Petrological data suggest that the Mariana Trough peridotites are moderately depleted residues after partial melting of the upper mantle. Although some peridotite samples are affected by small-scale metasomatism, there is no evidence of pervasive post-melting metasomatism or melt-mantle interaction. Spinel compositions plot in the field for abyssal peridotites. Clinopyroxenes show depletions in Ti, Zr, and REE that are intermediate between those documented for peridotites from the Vulcan and Bouvet fracture zones (the American-Antarctic and Southwest Indian ridges, respectively). The open-system melting model indicates that the Mariana Trough peridotite compositions roughly correspond to theoretical residual compositions after similar to7% near-fractional melting of a depleted MORB-type upper mantle with only little melt or fluid/mantle interactions. The low degree of melting is consistent with a low magma budget, resulting in ultramafic exposure. We infer that the mantle flow beneath the Mariana Trough Central Graben is episodic, resulting in varying magma supply rate at spreading segments."

This record reveals the presence of 100,000-year periodicity in inclination and intensity, which suggests that the magnetic field is modulated by orbital eccentricity. The correlation between inclination and intensity shifted from antiphase to in-phase, corresponding to a magnetic polarity change from reversed to normal. To explain the observation, we propose a model in which the strength of the geocentric axial dipole field varies with 100,000-year periodicity, whereas persistent nondipole components do not."

                        "en": "We report a paleomagnetic secular variation in the Society Islands, French Polynesia for the past 5 Ma. Paleomagnetic measurements were performed on volcanic rocks applying thermal and alternating field demagnetizations and principal-component analysis. As a result, 82 normal, 48 reversed, and 10 intermediate directions were observed after the correction of the site localities for the absolute motion of the Pacific plate. A mean VGP of the combined data set of normal and reversed polarities is located at 87.5degreesN and 4.0degreesW (A(95) = 2.3degrees), which is close to the geographic pole. The angular standard deviation (ASD) around the mean VGP resulted in 14.6degrees (+1.3degrees, -1.2degrees). There is no significant inclination anomaly for the time-averaged field. However, if the plate motion is not taken into account, a significant anomaly of -3.4degrees would be observed at a 95% confidence level. This suggests that correction for the absolute plate motion is needed for the precise paleodirectional analysis of the Pacific region. These features are also supported by an analysis combining the previous data set with our data."

                        "en": "We conducted a mineral magnetic study on sand samples from the Taklimakan desert, Tarim Basin in western China. Modern sands were collected at 19 sites in the central and western parts of the Taklimakan desert. We carried out low-field susceptibility measurements, ARM and IRM acquisitions, high- and low-temperature measurements and hysteresis measurements on these samples. Nearly stoichiometric magnetite is the dominant magnetic mineral of these samples. The presence of titanomagnetite is unlikely, and contributions from a high-coercivity mineral(s) are minor. Magnetic grain size is estimated to be that of larger pseudo-single domain or even greater. We compared the hysteresis data against loess samples from both pristine and weathered loess sections from the Chinese Loess Plateau. We found an apparent decreasing grain size trend from the Taklimakan to the central Loess Plateau through the western Loess Plateau. These lines of evidence favour the idea that the Taklimakan desert is one of the potential dust source areas, even though it is located more than 2000 km west of the central Loess Plateau."

                        "en": "Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) analysis has been conducted on samples from borehole core CM-97 from the Yangtze River (Changjiang) incised-valley fill, China, to determine the paleocurrent directions to help in reconstructing sedimentary paleoenvironments. Borehole CM-97 consists of fluvial (Unit 1), estuarine (Units 2-6), and deltaic (Units 7-9) sediments after the Last Glacial Maximum in ascending order. The AMS results show that the paleocurrent directions for the tide-dominated estuarine and deltaic sediments were westerly or northwesterly directed (flood-tide dominated), but give no definite trend for the fluvial sediments.\nComparison between the paleocurrent directions inferred from primary sedimentary structures and in situ AMS data shows that they are in good agreement, confirming the applicability of AMS as a good paleocurrent indicator for sediments deposited in coastal tide-dominated environments. Considering that these sediments were strongly tide-influenced and the tidal pattern since 12 kyr BP has not changed significantly, we think that the westerly or northwesterly current direction most probably resulted from flood-tidal currents, and the sedimentary paleoenvironment was a hood-tide dominated estuary or delta.\nAdditionally, it has been found that downhole changes of some AMS parameters, including the mean magnetic susceptibility (K), the corrected anisotropy degree (P-j) and the magnetic foliation (F), clearly mark the defined stratigraphic boundaries in the borehole. This further extends the validity of AMS as a good stratigraphic marker in addition to its long known credibility as a sensible paleocurrent recorder. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

                        "en": "A paleomagnetic study was performed on Hole 1082C sediment cores taken during the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 175 in the South Atlantic in order to obtain a high-resolution Brunhes-Matuyama (B/M) polarity transition record. An average sedimentation rate was as high as 10 cm/kyr. The cores consist of strongly anoxic sediments, which is common for the areas of large material supply. Anoxic sediments, which are geochemically quite active, were considered to be unsuitable for studies on detailed behavior of the geomagnetic field such as polarity transitions. For global site distribution, however, it is necessary to make efforts to retrieve paleomagnetic records from such sediments. A continuous record of directional changes around the transition was obtained from U-channel samples after cleaning by stepwise alternating-field (AF) demagnetization. Consistency of the record was checked using discrete samples taken from the other half of the cores. The coring-induced magnetic overprint of radial-inward direction, which has often been reported from ODP piston-cores, was negligibly small in our cores. Relative paleointensity variation was estimated from remanent intensities of the discrete samples normalized by artificial remanences. Our record shows following features of the B/M transition similar to those already reported by previous studies. A zone of large directional fluctuations with low paleointensities occurs just before the main transition (788 to 795 ka based on the oxygen-isotope stratigraphy), which would correspond to the \"precursor\" of Hartl and Tauxe (1996). The virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) at the precursor lie along the so-called preferred longitudinal bands over the north-south Americas and Australia-east Asia. After the main transition from the reversed to normal polarity, VGPs stayed in the middle-to-high latitudes over the North America with an intermediate paleointensity for about 5 kyrs, and then moved in the vicinity of the North Pole with full recovery of intensity. Such behavior was reported by Oda et al. (2000). These similarities suggest that the anoxic sediments at Site 1082 could record the behavior of the geomagnetic field rather faithfully, although the remanence may be of chemical origin."

Three cores have good age control from oxygen isotope stratigraphy. We extensively examined rock magnetic uniformity by the iso-thermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition and the alternating-field demagnetization of the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) and the IRM. Only rock-magnetically homogeneous sediments were used. Biogenic magnetites were found in all but one core and their dissolution in early diagenesis was not significant. The four cores showed coherent variations of the remanent intensity normalized by the ARM, implying that these variations represent the behavior of the geomagnetic field. Long-term paleointensity variations during the Brunhes chron are characterized by an asymmetric pattern. Rapid increases in the intensity occurred just after the Brunhes-Matuyama transition, in the mid-Brunhes from about 500 to 400 ka, and during the last 100 ka, and gradual decreases between them. The first one supports the idea of rapid regeneration of the geomagnetic field after polarity reversals [1]. The other two may have been triggered by very short polarity reversals. © 1995."

                        "en": "We conducted a paleomagnetic study of four sediment cores taken from different regions in the low latitudes of the Pacific Ocean in order to recover relative paleointensity variations during the Brunhes chron. Three cores have good age control from oxygen isotope stratigraphy. We extensively examined rock magnetic uniformity by the iso-thermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition and the alternating-field demagnetization of the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) and the IRM. Only rock-magnetically homogeneous sediments were used. Biogenic magnetites were found in all but one core and their dissolution in early diagenesis was not significant. The four cores showed coherent variations of the remanent intensity normalized by the ARM, implying that these variations represent the behavior of the geomagnetic field. Long-term paleointensity variations during the Brunhes chron are characterized by an asymmetric pattern. Rapid increases in the intensity occurred just after the Brunhes-Matuyama transition, in the mid-Brunhes from about 500 to 400 ka, and during the last 100 ka, and gradual decreases between them. The first one supports the idea of rapid regeneration of the geomagnetic field after polarity reversals [1]. The other two may have been triggered by very short polarity reversals. © 1995."

                        "en": "We have conducted a paleomagnetic study of five hemipelagic-clay cores of 4-7 m in length obtained from the West Caroline Basin, western equatorial Pacific. The purpose of this study is to clarify the long-term secular variation of the geomagnetic field during the last 200 kyr, using both intensity and directional changes. One core was dated using oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O), and characteristic magnetic susceptibility variations of about a factor of four allowed precise correlation between all cores. The magnetic mineralogy is estimated to be dominated by magnetite of single-domain (SD) and/or pseudo-single-domain (PSD) state. The magnetic mineralogy and grain size are uniform throughout the cores, which enabled us to obtain relative paleointensity variations as well as directional changes. Remanent intensity normalized by anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) indicates that sharp intensity drops (to ≤ 20% of the present field) occurred at about 40 and 190 kyr B.P., with a broader decrease around 110 kyr B.P. The former two are accompanied by anomalous remanent directions, suggesting short polarity reversals or excursions. Their ages are close to those of the previously reported Laschamp excursion and Biwa I event. A prominent intensity peak occurred immediately preceding the possible excursion at 40 kyr B.P. Our results are in general similar to the recently reported datasets spanning the last 80-140 kyr from the Somali Basin, the Mediterranean, and the Sulu Sea [1-3]. The inclination record shows long-term cyclic changes of several degrees in amplitude. The intervals of the recurring variation are 40-50 kyr, which is longer than the core's memory and is close to the Milankovitch frequency associated with the change in obliquity of Earth's rotational axis. We infer that an external force such as orbital forcing could be a cause of the long-term secular variation. © 1994."

Magnetic anomaly data and single-channel seismic reflection profiles were taken along ship's tracks typically with a 2-4 mile spacing. The transition from back-arc rifting to true seafloor spreading occurs at a structural boundary, which has NE-SW strike, at about 22°N. South of this boundary, clear magnetic lineations occur, and axial rift valleys on the spreading ridges are visible on the seismic profiles. Our identification of the magnetic lineations shows that the accretion of oceanic crust started at about 3.5 Ma with a spreading half-rate of ~ 2 cm/yr. The average spreading rate during the Brunhes chron is of the order of 1 cm/yr. The rate increases northward and is accompanied by a decrease in the relative depths of the axial rift valleys. A ridge-axis discontinuity is found at about 21°N. Two spreading axes overlap each other about 50 km along-strike, and are offset about 30 km. We interpret this discontinuity as an on-going ridge jump from the western axis to the eastern one. The southern end of the western axis is cut by a transform fault but the eastern axis is now propagating northwards. Arc volcanoes comprising the present volcanic front occur on the eastern flank of the spreading ridges, suggesting basinward migration of the volcanic arc. The spreading center of the Mariana Trough is located not at the center but on the eastern, or the volcanic arc, side of the trough in general. Offset is caused by the arcward ridge jump and the basinward migration of the volcanic arc. Asymmetric rifting before the beginning of the accretion of oceanic crust would be another reason for the offset. A row of rift grabens along the eastern margin of the trough north of 22°N, where the extension of island-arc crust is concentrated, continues to the spreading ridge south of 22°N. The arcward offset of spreading ridges is also found in the Lau Basin, suggesting that it is a common feature of the evolution of back-arc basins. © 1993."
