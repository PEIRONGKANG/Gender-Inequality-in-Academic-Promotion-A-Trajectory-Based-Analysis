We introduce our methods of carotid stenting in this paper. Initially, we deployed stents without protection devices and experienced 3 neurological complications (1 major stroke and 2 transient neurological deficits). After that, we developed a novel protective balloon catheter that occluded the distal internal carotid artery and was navigated under guidewire control. Our second method was to deploy stents after predilataion for the internal carotid stenosis using a smaller PTA balloon catheter and expand the stent under protection. The debri or clot that might appear during post dilation was aspirated and rinsed to the external carotid artery by a catheter introduced from the contralateral femoral artery. This method was applied for 37 lesions; transient neurological deficit due to embolic complication appeared in 1 case during the period of predilation.<br>Then, we started to use a protective balloon including the process of predilation. Initially, the protective balloon catheter was navigated distal portion of the stenosis under guidewire control. Then the guidewire was retrieved to be detached from the protective balloon catheter at the distal portion of the stenosis. The balloon was inflated at the distal internal carotid artery and a PTA balloon catheter was introduced into the stenotic portion and the stenosis was fully dilated. The guidewire was withdrawn and the occluded lumen of the internal carotid artery was rinsed by saline and debri and clot were washed to the external carotid artery. Then, protective balloon was deflated and the guidewire was introduced into the PTA balloon and PTA balloon was withdrawn. Finally a stent was deployed to cross the lesion. Twenty-four lesions were treated with this method without neurological complication. Postdilation under balloon protection was added only for two of 24 cases. This method was simple and effective to prevent embolic complications.",

                        "en": "The authors report a case of symptomatic basilar artery stenosis treated by stenting via the surgically exposed C1 vertebral artery. This case was initially treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty via a transfemoral route but resulted in unsatisfactory dilatation. Stenting via a transfemoral route also resulted in failure because of the: coiling of the proximal vertebral artery. Direct puncture of the vertebral artery beyond the coiling portion was tried but a stent could not be delivered beyond the C2 vertebrae, Finally, the vertebral artery was surgically exposed between C1 and the occipital bone and a stent was introduced into the lesion from this portion under fluoroscopic control. The basilar artery was fully opened by stenting without new neurological deficits. Stenting of the basilar artery via a transfemoral route is not always possible even with newer generation stents if the vertebral artery has elongated tortuous curves. Combined surgery and endovascular stenting is one of the alternatives in such cases including our case."

After percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for 63 cases of internal carotid stenoses 13 cases of restenosis appeared. They were treated by PTA or carotid endarterectomy. The treatment was chosen by the patient after explanation of each treatment. We initially treated seven patients by repeat PTA and six by carotid endarterectomy. The degree of stenosis improved from 82 % to 30 % on average after repeated PTA. However, one patient in the PTA group had restenosis, and carotid endarterectomy was then performed. The other cases also had restenosis and were treated by PTA. The six cases treated by carotid endarterectomy were successfully treated without difficulty. The success rate of PTA was 5/7 (71 %) in the restenosis cases. Patients with a greater residual stenosis after initial PTA had significantly more frequent restenosis. Repeat PTA and CEA both appeared effective treatment for restenosis after initial PTA, although PTA had a restenosis rate similar to that of initial PTA."

The diameter of the tumour was 30 mm, and its main feeding artery was the left lateral posterior choroidal artery. This vessel was embolised with microcoils, At 8 months following embolisation, the diameter of the tumour had decreased and was stable. The gamma knife was chosen as an adjuvant therapy for the further control 13 months alter embolisation. Embolisation and gamma knife therapy may be an alternative treatment for meningiomas where surgical resection appears difficult."

We devised a Y-shaped shunt tube for the CEA, through which a balloon catheter was introduced to perform PTA guided by mobile digital subtraction angiography. No cerebrovascular events occurred during follow-up. Our approach avoids the risk of a second procedure while effectively treating tandem stenoses."

The cause of this complication was thought to he perforation by the guide wire during catheterization at the sharp bend in the sphenoidal portion of the middle meningeal artery. Embolization of the fistula and the feeding artery to the meningioma with polyvinyl alcohol particles 250-355 μm size resulted in complete obliteration of the fistula. Computed tomography showed no epidural or subdural hematoma. Introduction of the microcatheter beyond the sharp bend in the middle meningeal artery should not be attempted to avoid the possibility of iatrogenic middle meningeal arteriovenous fistula."

                        "en": "Objective-Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the distal vertebral and basilar artery is now being performed in selected patients with haemodynamically significant lesions of the posterior cerebral circulation. Its effect and overall results were examined.\nPatients and methods-A balloon dilatation catheter specifically developed for these procedures, with a 2.0-3.5 mm balloon diameter, at 6 atmospheres of pressure, was used. Angioplasty was performed in 12 patients (including six whose initial results have been reported) with angiographically documented stenotic lesions involving either the intracranial vertebral artery (C1-C2 portion) or the basilar artery, and satisfying the following criteria: (1) clinical symptoms suggestive or consistent with a transient ischaemic attack refractory to medical treatment, or small infarction of the posterior circulation; and (2) angiographically documented stenosis greater than 70%. Two of 12 patients had complete thrombosis of the distal vertebral and basilar artery and PTA was performed after successful intra-arterial thrombolysis.\nResults-Successful results, without complications, were obtained in eight patients, with complete resolution of vertebrobasilar ischaemic symptoms. complications occurred in four patients including two with vessel dissection, and two with thromboembolism. The two patients with acute arterial dissection were reoperated but developed smalt infarctions with permanent neurological deficits. The two patients with thromboembolic complication showed transient neurological deficit. The overall stenosis ratio decreased from a mean of 84% pretreatment to 44% after the angioplasty procedure. Restenosis occurred in two patients. Long term clinical follow up in 11 patients who survived more than six months showed resolution of ischaemic symptoms after PTA in all except for one with a restenosis who had recurrent transient ischaemic attacks.\nConclusion-Transluminal angioplasty may be an effective procedure to treat vertebrobasilar ischaemia secondary to high grade arteriosclerotic disease affecting either the distal vertebral or basilar artery regions that do not respond to medical treatment."
