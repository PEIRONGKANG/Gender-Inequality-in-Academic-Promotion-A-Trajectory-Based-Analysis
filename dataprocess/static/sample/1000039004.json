In the laminar regime of chaos intermittency, the periodic solution before the saddle node bifurcation is closely related to its generation, and its behavior becomes periodic in a short time; the laminar is not, however, a periodic solution, and there are no unstable periodic solutions nearby. Most chaos control methods cannot be applied to the problem of stabilizing a laminar response to a periodic solution since they refer to information about unstable periodic orbits. In this paper, we demonstrate a control method that can be applied to the control target that laminar phase of a dynamical system exhibiting chaos intermittency. This method records the time series of a periodic solution prior to the saddle node bifurcation as a pseudo-periodic orbit and feeds it to the control target back. We report that when this control method is applied to a circuit model, laminar motion can be stabilized to a periodic solution via control inputs of very small magnitude, and robust control can be obtained.",

In the diagram, the border-collision bifurcation setsshow a novel bifurcation structure that resembles the `strike-slip fault' observed ingeology. This structure implies that, before and after the border-collision bifurcationoccurs, the stability of the periodic point discontinuously changes in some cases butmaintains in other cases. In addition, we demonstrate that a border-collision bifurcationsets successively branch at distinct points. This behavior results in a tree-like structurebeing observed in the border-collision bifurcation diagram; we refer to this structure asa border-collision bifurcation tree.

In this paper, we develop a preprocessor that gives Jacobian matrix and partial derivatives symbolically by using SymPy packages on the Python platform. Possibilities about the inclusion of errors are minimized by symbolic derivations and reducing loop structures. It imposes a user only on putting an expression of the equation into a JSON format file. We demonstrate bifurcation calculations for discrete neuron dynamical systems. The system includes an exponential function, which makes the calculation of derivatives complicated, but we show that it can be implemented simply by using symbolic differentiation.",

In thisstudy, we similarly configure the system as a hybrid system by modeling the amplification characteristics of the operationalamplifier as piecewise constant or piecewise linear characteristics. Furthermore, the system is constructed as a time-delayeddynamical system by considering the first-order delay characteristics of the operational amplifier.

In this paper, we consider the transformation to analyze bifurcation structures. The Poincar´emap of the periodic solution has a fixed point, which is a condition for non-hyperbolicity, in common with the forward andbackward time systems, and the stability of the fixed points is interchanged. As an example, we perform numerical analysis offorward and backward time systems in a two-dimensional non-autonomous electrical circuit. As a result, we confirmed that theparameter regime that corresponds to the divergent regime in the forward time system can sometimes be observed as a periodicsolution in the backward time system. We also report that there are strange attractors in the phase space of the backward timesystem that cannot be seen in the forward time direction."

In this study, we performed numerical experiments using the general Wilson-Cowan modelwith one excitatory neuron group. The results showed that the local branching structure changed as the excitatory neuronsvalue fluctuated.
