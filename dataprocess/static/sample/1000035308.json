Lard and ferric oxinate(Fe-Ox) were used as models of fatty soil and particulate soil, respectively. Test cloths used were cotton fabrics and polyester fabrics. The results obtained were as follows\n (1) Recoveries of lard and Fe-Ox adhered individually to cloths were about 100%, irrespective of the kind of fibers and aging period of days. On the other hand, the recovery of Fe-Ox on the cloths tainted with mixture of lard and Fe-Ox decreased markedly as aging period of days passed, while that of lard was about 100% in each case. (2) The effect of aging on the detergency of Fe-Ox adhered individually to cloths was not recognized. (3) The detergency behavior of lard on the cloths tainted with mixture of lard and Fe-Ox was similar to that of lard adhered individually to cloths. And the detergency of Fe-Ox coexisted with lard resembled that of lard on the same soiled cloths. © 1993, The Japan Research Association for Textile End-Uses. All rights reserved."

Deposited amounts and the rate of deposition of PS latex particles onto cotton and Nylon-6 fibers in the presence of Na-CMC were less than when Na-CMC was absent. Elimination of the effect of Na-CMC for deposition may thus possibly be due primarily to electrostatic repulsive interactions, since total interaction energy (V<SUB>T</SUB>) due to electrostatic and van der Waals forces between latex particles and fibers increases greatly with the addition of Na-CMC.

Deposited amounts and the rate of deposition of PS latex particles onto cotton and Nylon-6 fibers in the presence of Na-CMC were less than when Na-CMC was absent. Elimination of the effect of Na-CMC for deposition may thus possibly be due primarily to electrostatic repulsive interactions, since total interaction energy (V<SUB>T</SUB>) due to electrostatic and van der Waals forces between latex particles and fibers increases greatly with the addition of Na-CMC. The addition of Na-CMC had virtually no effect on V<SUB>T</SUB> for Nylon-6 fiber, and thus possibly steric repulsive interactions due to Na-CMC adsorbed on Nylon-6 fiber may be essential to the deposition of PS latex particles.",

                        "en": "The study was performed to make clear the influence of autoxidation of fatty soils on clothes to detergency. Refined lard and soybean oil were used as fatty soils which adhere to clothes during cooking tasks. The results obtained were as follows Extraction of lard on cloths after autoxidation by aging was done with ethyl ether completely, but it was necessary to extract soybean oil with ethanol followed by ethyl ether. 2) When aging temperature was 40°C, autoxidation of lard started at the beginning of aging. But that of soybean oil began about 10 days after the beginning of aging. Once autoxidation started, the rate of autoxidation of soybean oil was higher than that of lard. 3) The detergency of lard on cotton cloths aged for 20 days at 40°C was lower than that without aging, but the reverse tendency was seen on polyester cloths. Soybean oil adhered to cotton and polyester cloths was hardly removed by washing after 20 -day aging. © 1989, The Japan Research Association for Textile End-Uses. All rights reserved."
