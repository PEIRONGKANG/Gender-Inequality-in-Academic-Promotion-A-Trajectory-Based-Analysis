The purpose of this study was to investigate the children's comprehension after being taught by conventional instruction, and to propose a new teaching strategy. For this purpose, we conducted research and instruction on a third grade class, lower secondary school. The following results were obtained: (1) On the learning of electric circuits, the children made superficial progress in learning to calculate the intensity of electric currents, voltage and electrical resistance by using scientific laws; at the same time, the children developed a \"traffic flow model\" of electric circuits. It is not easy to exchange their traffic flow model with the scientific model. (2) To exchange their traffic model with the scientific model, it is useful to use a two step teaching approach: First to enrich the children's knowledge and, second to use \"the method of restructurization\" that restructures those ideas learned in the first step.",

But in the first half of the 80's, environmental education policy has declined rapidly. We think this decline is result of incomplete integration of environmental education into the educational system. In the latter half of the 80's and 90's, environmental education policy has been revived. This revival waw activated by grass-roots activity by environmental education advocates and was accelerated by the National Environmental Education Act. At present, environmental education has a chance to take part in educational reform and be successfully integrated into the educational system. Wisconsin, Arizona and Florida are states with advanced environmental education policy. For example, Arizona has a fine and comprehensive state plan for environmental education. Wisconsin has an environmental education center which supports state-wide in-service teacher education and environmental education assessment. Florida has a network of state agencies for environmental education and environmental education trust funds. The above cases are taken up in this paper.",
