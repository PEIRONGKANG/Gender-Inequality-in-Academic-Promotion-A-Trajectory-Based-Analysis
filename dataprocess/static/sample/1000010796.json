                        "en": "Heat shock proteins (Hsp) 70 are a ubiquitous family of molecular chaperones involved in many cellular processes. A yeast strain, ssa1/2, with two functionally redundant cytosolic Hsp70s (SSA1 and SSA2) deleted shows thermotolerance comparable to mildly heat-shocked wild type yeast, as well as increased protein synthesis and ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation. Since mRNA abundance does not always correlate well with protein expression levels it is essential to study proteins directly. We used a gel-based approach to identify stress-responsive proteins in the ssa1/2 mutant and identified 43 differentially expressed spots. These were trypsin-digested and analyzed by nano electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-LC-MSIMS). A total of 22 non-redundant proteins were identified, 11 of which were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Nine proteins, most of which were up-regulated (2-fold or more) in the ssa1/2 mutant, proved to be stress-inducible proteins such as molecular chaperones and anti-oxidant proteins, or proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism. Interestingly, a translational factor Hyp2p up-regulated in the mutant was also found to be highly phosphorylated. These results indicate that the cytosolic Hsp70s, Ssa1p and Ssa2p, regulate an abundance of proteins mainly involved in stress responses and protein synthesis."

                        "en": "Background: A yeast strain lacking the two genes SSA1 and SSA2, which encode cytosolic molecular chaperones, acquires thermotolerance as well as the mild heat-shocked wild-type yeast strain. We investigated the genomic response at the level of mRNA expression to the deletion of SSA1/2 in comparison with the mild heat-shocked wild-type using cDNA microarray.\nResults: Yeast cDNA microarray analysis revealed that genes involved in the stress response, including molecular chaperones, were up-regulated in a similar manner in both the ssa1/2 deletion mutant and the mild heat-shocked wild-type. Genes involved in protein synthesis were upregulated in the ssa1/2 deletion mutant, but were markedly suppressed in the mild heat-shocked wild-type. The genes involved in ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation were also up-regulated in the ssa1/2 deletion mutant, whereas the unfolded protein response (UPR) genes were highly expressed in the mild heat-shocked wild-type. RT-PCR confirmed that the genes regulating protein synthesis and cytosolic protein degradation were up-regulated in the ssa1/2 deletion mutant. At the translational level, more ubiquitinated proteins and proteasomes were detected in the ssa1/2 deletion mutant, than in the wild-type, confirming that ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation was up-regulated by the deletion of SSA1/2.\nConclusion: These results suggest that the mechanism for rescue of denatured proteins in the ssa1/2 deletion mutant is different from that in the mild heat-shocked wild-type: Activated protein synthesis in the ssa1/2 deletion mutant supplies a deficiency of proteins by their degradation, whereas mild heat-shock induces UPR."

Here we found the action of iodine on gene expression level, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a DNA microarray. It was found that, like antimicrobial activity, iodine causes an immediate and dose-dependent (0.5 mM, 0.75 mM and 1 mM) transcriptional alteration in yeast cells. The effects of iodine continued after the first immediate response. Genes for c-compound and carbohydrate metabolism, for energy, and for cell rescue were continuously up-regulated. On the other hand, genes related to protein fate were induced especially at 0.5 h. The gene expression profile at 0.5 h was significantly different from that of a longer iodine exposed condition. The main reaction at 0.5 h after iodine addition might be due to oxidative toxicity, and the profile at 0.5 h was similar to that of an agricultural bactericide."

Boar TP2 has three potential zinc finger motifs and binds three atoms of zinc per molecule. However the structure of the zinc-binding domain of boar TP2 has not been completely determined. To elucidate the local structure around the zinc atoms of boar TP2, we performed an X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurement on the zinc-binding domain of TP2(TP2Z)( residues 1-103) in the fluorescence mode. By EXAFS analyses we have demonstrated that each of the three zinc atoms is coordinated by approximately two sulfur and two nitrogen atoms on average. The average Zn-S and Zn-N distances were found to be 2.36 Angstrom and 2.01 Angstrom, respectively. The sulfur and nitrogen atoms are attributed to cysteine and histidine residues, respectively, from comparison of the EXAFS spectra with model compounds ZnS and ZnTPP(zinc(II) tetraphenylporphyrin)."

                        "en": "Boar Spermatidal Transition Protein 2 (TP2; 137 amino acid residues) is supposed to play an important role in initiation of chromatin condensation and cessation of transcriptional activity during mammalian spermiogenesis. Boar TP2 has three potential zinc finger motifs and binds three atoms of zinc per molecule. However the structure of the zinc-binding domain of boar TP2 has not been completely determined. To elucidate the local structure around the zinc atoms of boar TP2, we performed an X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurement on the zinc-binding domain of TP2(TP2Z)( residues 1-103) in the fluorescence mode. By EXAFS analyses we have demonstrated that each of the three zinc atoms is coordinated by approximately two sulfur and two nitrogen atoms on average. The average Zn-S and Zn-N distances were found to be 2.36 Angstrom and 2.01 Angstrom, respectively. The sulfur and nitrogen atoms are attributed to cysteine and histidine residues, respectively, from comparison of the EXAFS spectra with model compounds ZnS and ZnTPP(zinc(II) tetraphenylporphyrin)."

These results suggest that TP4 contributes to the chromatin reorganization in the late spermatid nuclei from nucleosomal-type structure with negatively supercoiled DNA to nucleoprotamine structure with no supercoiled DNA, (C) 1999 Federation of European Biochemical Societies."

TP1 dimer with intermolecular disulfide bond had similar DNA-melting activity to TP1, but was not detected in extracts from boar late spermatid nuclei. These results suggest that TP1 dimer without intermolecular disulfide bond induces local destabilization of DNA in the late spermatid nuclei."

CD spectroscopy study showed that TP2 underwent a small but significant zinc dependent secondary structural change. TP2, having three potential zinc finger motifs, was shown to be contain 3 atoms of zinc bound per molecule of the protein by atomic absorption spectroscopy. These results together with the amino acid sequence of TP2 suggest that TP2 is a zinc metalloprotein with three zinc finger structures."

From the results of quenching of the tyrosine fluorescence of TP1 and the tryptophan fluorescence of TP3 upon their binding to double-stranded and single-stranded boar liver nucleosome core DNA at 50 mM NaCl, the apparent association constants for the binding of TP1 to double- and single-stranded DNA were calculated to be 8.0x10(4) and 1.3X10(5) M(-1), respectively, and those for the binding of TP3 to double- and single-stranded DNA to be 7.1X10(4) and 1.8X10(5) M(-1), respectively, These results suggest that TP1 and TP3, having higher affinity for single-stranded DNA, induce local destabilization of DNA, probably through the stacking of Tyr32 and Trp18 with nucleic acid bases, respectively."
