                        "en": "We previously reported the generation of fertile diploid adult fish with a donor marker by transfer of adult somatic cell nuclei to recipient diploidized eggs without enucleation in medaka (Oryzias latipes). Although transplants appeared similar to clones of donor fish, the possibility existed that they were chimeras of cells originating from both the donor and recipient nuclei. To clarify the nuclear origin of transplants, the green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) was used as the recipient marker and the DMY/dmrt1bY gene, which directs male differentiation. in medaka, was used as the donor marker. The marker genes were examined in the transplants by fluorescence microscopy, polymerase chain reaction assays, and transmission to the progeny. Of the seven adult fish obtained from 974 nuclear transfer procedures, six were analyzed in detail. Three of these exhibited the donor phenotype but did not have the recipient marker, suggesting that they were donor clones. The other three showed GFP expression, with one exhibiting an apparent chimerism in both donor and recipient genetic markers and the other two considered to be parthenogenic. Elucidation of a mechanism capable of eliminating recipient nuclei from nuclear transplants is considered to be key to the establishment of cloning techniques in fish."

                        "en": "We previously reported the generation of fertile diploid adult fish with a donor marker by transfer of adult somatic cell nuclei to recipient diploidized eggs without enucleation in medaka (Oryzias latipes). Although transplants appeared similar to clones of donor fish, the possibility existed that they were chimeras of cells originating from both the donor and recipient nuclei. To clarify the nuclear origin of transplants, the green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) was used as the recipient marker and the DMY/dmrt1bY gene, which directs male differentiation. in medaka, was used as the donor marker. The marker genes were examined in the transplants by fluorescence microscopy, polymerase chain reaction assays, and transmission to the progeny. Of the seven adult fish obtained from 974 nuclear transfer procedures, six were analyzed in detail. Three of these exhibited the donor phenotype but did not have the recipient marker, suggesting that they were donor clones. The other three showed GFP expression, with one exhibiting an apparent chimerism in both donor and recipient genetic markers and the other two considered to be parthenogenic. Elucidation of a mechanism capable of eliminating recipient nuclei from nuclear transplants is considered to be key to the establishment of cloning techniques in fish."

                        "en": "Until recently, the nuclear transfer of adult somatic cell nuclei in fish has been unsuccessful. This is primarily because of chromosomal aberrations in nuclear transplants, which are thought to arise due to asynchrony between the cell cycles of the recipient egg and donor nucleus. We recently succeeded in circumventing this difficulty by using a new nuclear transfer method in medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). Instead of enucleated eggs, the method uses non-enucleated and diploidized eggs, obtained by retention of the second polar body release, as recipients in the nuclear transfer of primary culture cells from the caudal fin of an adult green fluorescent protein gene (GFP)-transgenic strain. We found that 2.7% of the reconstructed embryos grew into diploid and fertile adults exhibiting donor expression characteristics and transmission of the GFP marker gene to progeny. The mechanism underlying the generation of nuclear transplants using this method is unknown at present; however, analyses of donor and recipient nuclei behavior and the cytoskeletal mechanisms involved in the early developmental stages, as well as the special ability of diploidized eggs to facilitate reprogramming of the donor nuclei will result in elucidation of the mechanism."

                        "en": "Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) is a glycoprotein belonging to the TGF-beta superfamily. In mammals, MIS is responsible for the regression of Mullerian ducts in the male fetus. However, the role of MIS in gonadal sex differentiation of teleost fish, which have no Mullerian ducts, has yet to be clarified. In the present study, we examined the expression pattern of mis and mis type 2 receptor (misr2) mRNAs and the function of MIS signaling in early gonadal differentiation in medaka (teleost, Oryzias latipes). In situ hybridization showed that both mis and misr2 mRNAs were expressed in the somatic cells surrounding the germ cells of both sexes during early sex differentiation. Loss-of-function of either MIS or MIS type II receptor (MISRII) in medaka resulted in suppression of germ cell proliferation during sex differentiation. These results were supported by cell proliferation assay using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling analysis. Treatment of tissue fragments containing germ cells with recombinant eel MIS significantly induced germ cell proliferation in both sexes compared with the untreated control. On the other hand, culture of tissue fragments from the MIS- or MISRII-defective embryos inhibited proliferation of germ cells in both sexes. Moreover, treatment with recombinant eel MIS in the MIS- defective embryos dose-dependently increased germ cell number in both sexes, whereas in the MISRII-defective embryos, it did not permit proliferation of germ cells. These results suggest that in medaka, MIS indirectly stimulates germ cell proliferation through MISRII, expressed in the somatic cells immediately after they reach the gonadal primordium."

                        "en": "Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) is a glycoprotein belonging to the TGF-beta superfamily. In mammals, MIS is responsible for the regression of Mullerian ducts in the male fetus. However, the role of MIS in gonadal sex differentiation of teleost fish, which have no Mullerian ducts, has yet to be clarified. In the present study, we examined the expression pattern of mis and mis type 2 receptor (misr2) mRNAs and the function of MIS signaling in early gonadal differentiation in medaka (teleost, Oryzias latipes). In situ hybridization showed that both mis and misr2 mRNAs were expressed in the somatic cells surrounding the germ cells of both sexes during early sex differentiation. Loss-of-function of either MIS or MIS type II receptor (MISRII) in medaka resulted in suppression of germ cell proliferation during sex differentiation. These results were supported by cell proliferation assay using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling analysis. Treatment of tissue fragments containing germ cells with recombinant eel MIS significantly induced germ cell proliferation in both sexes compared with the untreated control. On the other hand, culture of tissue fragments from the MIS- or MISRII-defective embryos inhibited proliferation of germ cells in both sexes. Moreover, treatment with recombinant eel MIS in the MIS- defective embryos dose-dependently increased germ cell number in both sexes, whereas in the MISRII-defective embryos, it did not permit proliferation of germ cells. These results suggest that in medaka, MIS indirectly stimulates germ cell proliferation through MISRII, expressed in the somatic cells immediately after they reach the gonadal primordium."

In order to normalize the chromosomal status, we used diploidized eggs by retention of second polar body release, instead of enucleated eggs, as recipients in nuclear transfer of primary culture cells from the caudal fin of adult green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) transgenic medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). We found that 2.7% of the reconstructed embryos grew into adults that expressed GFP in various tissues in the same pattern as in the donor fish. Moreover, these fish were diploid, fertile and capable of passing the marker gene to the next generation in Mendelian fashion. We hesitate to call these fish 'clones' because we used non-enucleated eggs as recipients; in effect, they may be chimeras consisting of cells derived from diploid recipient nuclei and donor nuclei. In either case, fish adult somatic cell nuclei were reprogrammed to pluripotency and differentiated into a variety of cell types including germ cells via the use of diploidized recipient eggs."

                        "en": "Chromosomal abnormalities such as ploidy mosaicism have constituted a major obstacle to the successful nuclear transfer of adult somatic cell nuclei in lower vertebrates to date. Euploid mosaicism has been reported previously in well-developed amphibian transplants. Here, we investigated ploidy mosaicisms in well-developed transplants of adult somatic cell nuclei in medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). Donor nuclei from primary cultured cells from the adult caudal fin of a transgenic strain carrying the green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) were transferred to recipient nonenucleated eggs of a wild-type strain to produce 662 transplants. While some of the transplants developed beyond the body formation stage and several hatched, all exhibited varying degrees of abnormal morphology, limited growth and subsequent death. Twenty-one transplants, 19 embryos and two larvae, were selected for chromosomal analysis; all were well-developed 6-day-old or later embryonic stages exhibiting slight morphological abnormalities and the same pattern of GFP expression as that of the donor strain. In addition, all exhibited various levels of euploid mosaicism with haploid-diploid, haploid-triploid or haploid-diploid-triploid chromosome sets. No visible chromosomal abnormalities were observed. Thus, euploid mosaicism similar to that observed in amphibians was confirmed in well-developed nuclear transplants of fish."

                        "en": "Toll is an active DNA-based transposable element residing in the genome of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes. This element belongs to the hAT transposable element family, of which complete copies have relatively long sequences. In addition, we found that Toll elements as long as 18 and 20 kb occur in the medaka fish genome. These facts suggest that Toll is suitable for carrying large DNA fragments as a gene transfer vector. Focusing on this, we conducted two kinds of manipulations of the element. The first was to eliminate internal regions dispensable for transposition. It was revealed that a Toll element consisting of 157-bp left- and 106-bp right-terminal regions could be transposed without a loss of transposition efficiency. Next, we prepared long Toll elements by incorporating unrelated DNA fragments into this short Toll clone and examined their transposition efficiencies. The transposition frequency decreased as the element size increased. The longest Toll element we examined measured 22.1 kb, and its transposition frequency was approximately one fifth that of a 2.1-kb element. However, this frequency was still significantly higher than that of a random integration of DNA into the chromosomes. The element size of 22.1 kb is the longest ever reported for DNA-based elements currently used for mammals. Thus, Toll is a superior gene-transfer vector with a large cargo capacity."

In order to normalize the chromosomal status, we used diploidized eggs by retention of second polar body release, instead of enucleated eggs, as recipients in nuclear transfer of primary culture cells from the caudal fin of adult green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) transgenic medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). We found that 2.7% of the reconstructed embryos grew into adults that expressed GFP in various tissues in the same pattern as in the donor fish. Moreover, these fish were diploid, fertile and capable of passing the marker gene to the next generation in Mendelian fashion. We hesitate to call these fish 'clones' because we used non-enucleated eggs as recipients; in effect, they may be chimeras consisting of cells derived from diploid recipient nuclei and donor nuclei. In either case, fish adult somatic cell nuclei were reprogrammed to pluripotency and differentiated into a variety of cell types including germ cells via the use of diploidized recipient eggs."

Euploid mosaicism has been reported previously in well-developed amphibian transplants. Here, we investigated ploidy mosaicisms in well-developed transplants of adult somatic cell nuclei in medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). Donor nuclei from primary cultured cells from the adult caudal fin of a transgenic strain carrying the green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) were transferred to recipient nonenucleated eggs of a wild-type strain to produce 662 transplants. While some of the transplants developed beyond the body formation stage and several hatched, all exhibited varying degrees of abnormal morphology, limited growth and subsequent death. Twenty-one transplants, 19 embryos and two larvae, were selected for chromosomal analysis; all were well-developed 6-day-old or later embryonic stages exhibiting slight morphological abnormalities and the same pattern of GFP expression as that of the donor strain. In addition, all exhibited various levels of euploid mosaicism with haploid-diploid, haploid-triploid or haploid-diploid-triploid chromosome sets. No visible chromosomal abnormalities were observed. Thus, euploid mosaicism similar to that observed in amphibians was confirmed in well-developed nuclear transplants of fish."

                        "en": "Toll is an active DNA-based transposable element residing in the genome of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes. This element belongs to the hAT transposable element family, of which complete copies have relatively long sequences. In addition, we found that Toll elements as long as 18 and 20 kb occur in the medaka fish genome. These facts suggest that Toll is suitable for carrying large DNA fragments as a gene transfer vector. Focusing on this, we conducted two kinds of manipulations of the element. The first was to eliminate internal regions dispensable for transposition. It was revealed that a Toll element consisting of 157-bp left- and 106-bp right-terminal regions could be transposed without a loss of transposition efficiency. Next, we prepared long Toll elements by incorporating unrelated DNA fragments into this short Toll clone and examined their transposition efficiencies. The transposition frequency decreased as the element size increased. The longest Toll element we examined measured 22.1 kb, and its transposition frequency was approximately one fifth that of a 2.1-kb element. However, this frequency was still significantly higher than that of a random integration of DNA into the chromosomes. The element size of 22.1 kb is the longest ever reported for DNA-based elements currently used for mammals. Thus, Toll is a superior gene-transfer vector with a large cargo capacity."

The measurement of gonadal size calculating the GFP-fluorescent area was used as a technique that enabled monitoring gonads in living specimens by GFP fluorescence. First, mature medaka were exposed to EE2 (47.8-522 ng/L) for 4 weeks. The gonads showed a significant reduction of the GFP-fluorescent area and Gonadosomatic Index in males exposed to EE2 at &gt; 216 ng/L and females exposed at 522 ng/L. Histologically, males at all treatments exhibited testis-ova and additionally, high connective tissue prevalence at &gt;= 216 ng/L. Next, mature male medaka were exposed to EE2 (43.7-473 ng/L) for 3 weeks and allowed to depurate for 6 weeks, to investigate persistent effects of EE2. Continuous gonad observation showed that GFP began to decline 3 weeks after initial exposure to &gt;= 215 ng/L. After depuration, the gonad's fluorescent areas gradually recovered, with no statistical difference at the end of the depuration period; normal spermatogenesis was present in these individuals. Alterations in GFP fluorescence clearly indicate the condition of the gonad in transgenic medaka and this strain showed a facilitated screening fish model to detect the adverse effects on the gonad by estrogenic chemicals."

                        "en": "We used a recently introduced strain of medaka, the see-through medaka, whose internal organs can be seen through the skin, to develop an in situ toxicity assay of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity that detected fluorescence from resorufin, a metabolite of ethoxyresorufin and thus an indicator of CYP1A activity. EROD activity in the liver and gills of 2-week post-hatch see-through medaka exposed simultaneously to various concentrations of 3-methylcholanthrene and 200 mu g/L ethoxyresorufin for 24 h was proportional to the 3-methylcholanthrene dose. Activities in the liver and gills peaked at 40 mu g/L of 3-methylcholanthrene and then decreased at higher doses, possibly because of 3-methylcholanthrene toxicity. At I-week post-hatch stage, however, constant high EROD activity was observed in controls and at all 3-methylcholanthrene doses. Four-week post-hatch see-through medaka exhibited less EROD activity than 2-week post-hatch see-through medaka, and activity in the liver peaked at 100 mu g/L of 3-methylcholanthrene. Adult see-through medaka were not suitable for fluorescence detection owing to their thick skin, muscle and/or tissue. In tests of oxidative activity response to ethoxyresorufin, 1-day and 1-week post-hatch see-through medaka exhibited high intrinsic EROD activity in the liver, gills, and other organs in the absence of 3-methylcbolanthrene. This intrinsic activity declined with growth and explained the high constant EROD activity at 1-week post-hatch stage. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The measurement of gonadal size calculating the GFP-fluorescent area was used as a technique that enabled monitoring gonads in living specimens by GFP fluorescence. First, mature medaka were exposed to EE2 (47.8-522 ng/L) for 4 weeks. The gonads showed a significant reduction of the GFP-fluorescent area and Gonadosomatic Index in males exposed to EE2 at &gt; 216 ng/L and females exposed at 522 ng/L. Histologically, males at all treatments exhibited testis-ova and additionally, high connective tissue prevalence at &gt;= 216 ng/L. Next, mature male medaka were exposed to EE2 (43.7-473 ng/L) for 3 weeks and allowed to depurate for 6 weeks, to investigate persistent effects of EE2. Continuous gonad observation showed that GFP began to decline 3 weeks after initial exposure to &gt;= 215 ng/L. After depuration, the gonad's fluorescent areas gradually recovered, with no statistical difference at the end of the depuration period; normal spermatogenesis was present in these individuals. Alterations in GFP fluorescence clearly indicate the condition of the gonad in transgenic medaka and this strain showed a facilitated screening fish model to detect the adverse effects on the gonad by estrogenic chemicals."

                        "en": "We used a recently introduced strain of medaka, the see-through medaka, whose internal organs can be seen through the skin, to develop an in situ toxicity assay of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity that detected fluorescence from resorufin, a metabolite of ethoxyresorufin and thus an indicator of CYP1A activity. EROD activity in the liver and gills of 2-week post-hatch see-through medaka exposed simultaneously to various concentrations of 3-methylcholanthrene and 200 mu g/L ethoxyresorufin for 24 h was proportional to the 3-methylcholanthrene dose. Activities in the liver and gills peaked at 40 mu g/L of 3-methylcholanthrene and then decreased at higher doses, possibly because of 3-methylcholanthrene toxicity. At I-week post-hatch stage, however, constant high EROD activity was observed in controls and at all 3-methylcholanthrene doses. Four-week post-hatch see-through medaka exhibited less EROD activity than 2-week post-hatch see-through medaka, and activity in the liver peaked at 100 mu g/L of 3-methylcholanthrene. Adult see-through medaka were not suitable for fluorescence detection owing to their thick skin, muscle and/or tissue. In tests of oxidative activity response to ethoxyresorufin, 1-day and 1-week post-hatch see-through medaka exhibited high intrinsic EROD activity in the liver, gills, and other organs in the absence of 3-methylcbolanthrene. This intrinsic activity declined with growth and explained the high constant EROD activity at 1-week post-hatch stage. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Somatolactin (SL) plays an essential role in body-color regulation in medaka and is encoded by the color interfere (ci) locus. The ci mutant fish possess constitutively increased numbers of leucophores and a concomitant decrease in visible xanthophores. However, the mechanism of action of SL on these cell types, and the role of SL in body-color regulation in other species, is unknown. In this study, we verified an SL-xanthophore relationship in ci mutant fish using the leucophore free (lf) gene. Histological observation of lf larvae indicated that these mutants do not possess differentiated leucophores. The ci-lf double mutant, whose genotype was confirmed using DNA markers, lacked leucophores; however, the number of xanthophores remained low, demonstrating that leucophores are not necessary for mediating SL signaling to xanthophores. This finding suggests a conserved function for SL in xanthophore regulation across species, rather than the evolution of a medaka-specific and leucophore-dependent role of SL in body-color regulation. Our results also demonstrate that the lf gene has an indispensable role in leucophore development epistatic to SL signaling. The lf gene has not been cloned. The high-resolution recombination map surrounding the lf locus constructed in this study, together with medaka whole genome sequences that will be released soon, will allow the rapid cloning of the lf gene by forward genetic approaches."

                        "en": "Somatolactin (SL) plays an essential role in body-color regulation in medaka and is encoded by the color interfere (ci) locus. The ci mutant fish possess constitutively increased numbers of leucophores and a concomitant decrease in visible xanthophores. However, the mechanism of action of SL on these cell types, and the role of SL in body-color regulation in other species, is unknown. In this study, we verified an SL-xanthophore relationship in ci mutant fish using the leucophore free (lf) gene. Histological observation of lf larvae indicated that these mutants do not possess differentiated leucophores. The ci-lf double mutant, whose genotype was confirmed using DNA markers, lacked leucophores; however, the number of xanthophores remained low, demonstrating that leucophores are not necessary for mediating SL signaling to xanthophores. This finding suggests a conserved function for SL in xanthophore regulation across species, rather than the evolution of a medaka-specific and leucophore-dependent role of SL in body-color regulation. Our results also demonstrate that the lf gene has an indispensable role in leucophore development epistatic to SL signaling. The lf gene has not been cloned. The high-resolution recombination map surrounding the lf locus constructed in this study, together with medaka whole genome sequences that will be released soon, will allow the rapid cloning of the lf gene by forward genetic approaches."
