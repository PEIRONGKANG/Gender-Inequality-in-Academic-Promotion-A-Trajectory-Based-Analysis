                        "en": "The role of phenol condensation pathways in the formation of polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) in a municipal waste incinerator was assessed by comparing predicted PCDF homologue and isomer patterns with those obtained from the incinerator. A two-phenol condensation model, dependent only on the distribution of phenols, was used to predict the distributions of PCDF congeners in the incinerator. Complete distributions of phenols and PCDF congeners were obtained from the incinerator. To quantify the degree of agreement between obtained isomer distributions and those predicted by the model, R-squared values from linear correlations were Calculated for the dichlorinated- through hexachlorinated-isomers. They ranged from 0.001 to 0.1. Agreement between obtained and predicted PCDF isomers was very poor for all homologues, suggesting that phenol condensation pathways are unlikely to be the primary route in the formation of PCDF in the incinerator. However, dibenzofuran (DF) is likely to be produced from a condensation of two phenols. This paper shows the use of PCDF homologue and isomer patterns calculated by the two-phenol condensation model for testing PCDF formation mechanism attribution in a municipal waste incinerator.

Q-switched Nd:YAG laser [wavelength; 532nm, energy; 200mJ/pulse, pulse duration (FWHM); 6ns] and focal lens (focal length; 100mm) were used for the laser-induced air breakdown. Probabilities of the laser extinguishment were examined by varying the fuel concentration and the distance from the breakdown point to the counterflow diffusion flame. As a result, the two concentration limits of the laser extinguishment were clarified. One was the laser extinguishable limit, below which the counterflow diffusion flame could be extinguished perfectly by the laser-induced breakdown. The other was the laser inextinguishable limit, over which any flame could not be extinguished by the laser-induced breakdown. Moreover, we could consider that determination of the laser extinguishable limit was mainly influenced by the laser-induced blast wave. On the other hand, it could be thought that not only blast wave but also hot gas and turbulent mixing produced by the laser-induced breakdown influenced the determination of the laser inextinguishable limit.",

                        "en": "Combustion experiments performed in the presence of hydrogen chloride (HCI) in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor were carried out to elucidate the role of chlorine in the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs; together: PCDD/Fs) in various sections of a municipal waste incinerator. We first demonstrated that the homologue profile and the pattern of the congener proportions of PCDD/Fs for a model waste containing poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) combusted in the absence of HCI were similar to those for a PVC-free waste combusted in the presence of HCI. This showed no difference between PVC in the waste and injected HCI in the role as a chlorine source in PCDD/F formation during incineration. Next, to investigate PCDD/F formation in each section of the incinerator, we carried out combustion experiments with the PVC-free waste, injecting HCI at different locations of the incinerator. The amounts of PCDDs and PCDFs formed were significantly reduced when HCI was not supplied to the main combustion section. The presence of HCI in the main combustion section was essential for the formation of PCDD/Fs, even in the downstream sections. This finding indicates that compounds that were able to form PCDD/Fs in the downstream sections were mainly formed in the main combustion section in the presence of HCI."

A mixture of 20 phenols was synthesized and used as reactants for this study because phenols are known to be key precursors in the formation of PCDD/F. Experiments were conducted at 400 degrees C. The 92% of nitrogen (N-2) and 8% of oxygen (O-2) were used as a carrier gas. PCDD/F homologue and isomer patterns with dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD) and dibenzofuran (DF) were obtained from a mixture of 20 phenols. DF + PCDF formation was favored over DD + PCDD formation. The major homologue groups formed were non-chlorinated DD and DF, and PCDD/F homologue fraction decreased with the degree of chlorination. PCDD/F homologue and isomer distributions were almost constant. Phenol and lower chlorinated phenols present in high amount played an important role in PCDD/F congener distributions. The results presented here can be used as characteristics or fingerprints for homologue and isomer patterns of PCDD/F formation attribution in CuCl2-catalyzed reaction from phenols.

                        "en": "We studied polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation in laminar counterflow CH4-N-2/O-2-N-2 and C3Hg-N-2/O-2-N-2 nonpremixed flames using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) under widely varying experimental conditions. In this paper we describe the effect of varying the flame-controlling parameter on the formation of PAHs. The formation of most PAHs is enhanced by increasing the strain rate regardless of fuel species and the stoichiometric mixture fraction, Z(st). Increasing the dilution levels slightly suppresses PAH formation. However, the effect is quantitatively weak. PAH formation also is suppressed as Z(st) increases. However, the quantitative dependence of PAH formation on Z(st) variation is different between CH4 flames and C3H8 flames. Naphthalene is the most abundant compound under all experimental conditions in CH4 flames. On the other hand, for C3H8 flames, naphthalene is the most abundant compound in the range of smaller Z(st) while acenaphthylene is abundant under larger Z(st) conditions. For all experiments, under small Z(st) conditions, small-molecular-mass PAHs including naphthalene have significant concentration. Large-molecular-mass PAHs including acenaphthylene, which are-mostly 2- and 3-ring, are produced mainly for larger values of Z(st), when nonpremixed flames are established in the fuel stream. The formation behavior of PAHs in the counterflow nonpremixed flame is classified into two groups for C3H8 flames. One is the PAH group that has formation behavior similar to naphthalene, and the other is the PAH group that has formation behavior similar to acenaphthylene. It is experimentally observed that the effect of varying the initial C/O ratio on the PAH formation of nonpremixed flames is similar to that of previously reported numerical predictions for C2H2 premixed flames.

                        "en": "The role of phenol precursors in polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and dibenzofuran (PCDF) formation in municipal waste incinerators is assessed on the basis of homologue and isomer patterns. Homologue and isomer patterns of PCDD and PCDF congeners formed from phenols both in the gas phase and via particle-mediated reactions were studied in an isothermal flow reactor. A mixture of unsubsitituted phenol and 19 chlorinated phenols in relative concentrations found in a municipal waste incinerator (MWI) stack gas was used for this study. PCDD and PCDF homologue and isomer patterns obtained from the phenol experiments were compared with those observed in MWI data. From the phenol experiments, gas-phase formation at 600-700 degrees C favors PCDF formation whereas particle-mediated formation at 400 degrees C favors PCDD formation. Unsubstituted phenol, which was present in high concentration, played a significant role in the formation of PCDD/F congeners under both sets of experimental conditions. PCDD/F distributions in MWI flue gas and fly ash samples were different from those observed in the phenol experiments, suggesting that direct phenol condensation was not the primary route of PCDD/F formation at the incinerators. Gas-phase phenol condensation is a source of dibenzofuran, with subsequent particle-mediated chlorination resulting in PCDF formation. In the case of PCDD formation, phenol condensation may be responsible for the formation of certain highly chlorinated congeners. In this paper we demonstrate the use of homologue and isomer patterns for PCDD/F formation mechanism attribution in municipal waste incinerators."

                        "en": "Combustion experiments in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor were performed to elucidate the role of copper chloride in formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) during model waste incineration. The amounts of PCDDs and PCDFs formed, the homologue profiles, and the isomer distributions were measured in the flue gas from incineration of model wastes containing various levels of copper. A correlation was found between the Cu content of the waste and the proportion of each congener. An increase in copper enhanced the formation of certain congeners, showing that copper acts as a catalyst for formation of PCDDs and PCDFs. An increase in the copper content of the waste decreased the CO concentration in the flue gas and reduced the formation of PCDDs and PCDFs during incineration. This indicates that copper also works as an oxidation catalyst to promote combustion, leading to lower concentrations of products of incomplete combustion. It is indispensable to consider both roles of the catalyst, i.e., enhancement and suppression, in the formation of PCDDs and PCDFs during waste incineration, which are estimated separately from the isomer distributions and the amounts of PCDDs and PCDFs formed.

                        "en": "We investigated and quantified the extinction phenomena of laminar and turbulent counterflow CH4/N-2-O-2/N-2 nonpremixed flames. Experimental conditions such as the stoichiometric mixture fraction, the molar stoichiometry, and the turbulent flow characteristics are widely modulated. For a given set of experiments, the molar ratio of CH4-O-2-N-2 is held fixed. hence fixing the adiabatic flame temperature. The bulk velocity gradient at extinction, i.e., the critical strain rate, increases monotonically with increasing stoichiometric mixture fraction regardless of the initial turbulent flow property. For all the experimental conditions, extinction is more sensitive to variation in the mass fraction of oxygen in the oxidizer stream than that of methane in the fuel stream. If the extinction limit is quantified by the bulk velocity gradient, turbulence levels affect the extinction limit significantly when higher turbulence encounters the reaction zone directly. Estimations of the scalar dissipation rate at extinction are obtained from the experimentally observed quantities founded on the theoretical consideration of the flame characteristics. For the laminar counterflow nonpremixed flames, the critical value of the scalar dissipation rate at extinction, chi(q), scaled with that of the CH4-air laminar counterflow nonpremixed flames by the ratio of the bulk velocity gradient at extinction. This scaling is a suitable approximation for the present study. As to the turbulent flames, the scalar dissipation rates at extinction of the same stoichiometric mixture fraction are estimated including the contributions of both turbulent effect and mean flow effect. These show good agreement regardless of the initial turbulent flow condition. (C) 2004 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Combustion experiments in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor were conducted to elucidate the effects of copper chloride as a catalyst on polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) formation in municipal waste incineration. We used model wastes with and without copper chloride (CuCl2.2H(2)O), both of which contained polyvinyl chloride as a chlorine source. Combustion temperature was set to 900 degreesC, and the amount of air supplied was twice the stoichiometric ratio. The experimental setup was carefully planned to suppress the influences of experimental conditions except the waste composition. Results of these experiments showed that copper chloride in the waste increased the amount of PCDDs formed and made the homologue profile to shift towards the highly chlorinated species. Copper chloride contributes to the PCDDs formation by promoting chlorination, whereby the reaction is important in that organic matter is chlorinated directly by copper compounds. Copper chloride did not exert a great influence on the isomer distribution patterns of PCDDs, while there appeared a significant difference in the case of PCDFs. This points out the difference of the major formation mechanisms between PCDDs and PCDFs. PCDDs are less formed by the catalytic reactions from carbon/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons than PCDFs in our experimental conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Combustion experiments in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor have been performed to clarify the effects of copper chloride as a catalyst on polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) formation in municipal waste incineration. We used model wastes with and without copper chloride (CuCl2 . 2H(2)O) as a catalyst, both of which contained polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a chlorine source. Combustion temperature was set to 900degreesC, and the amount of air supplied was twice as much as the theoretical amount. The experimental setup had been carefully planned to ensure avoidance of the influences of previous experiments. Results of these present experiments revealed that copper chloride in the waste increased the amount of PCDFs formed and made the homologue profile shifted towards the highly chlorinated species. Copper chloride contributes to PCDFs formation by promoting chlorination via catalytic reactions, whereby the reaction could be important in that organic matters are chlorinated directly by chlorinated compounds related to Deacon reaction such as copper chloride. It was elucidated that characteristic isomer distribution patterns appeared in case the waste contained copper chloride. It is probable in our experiment with copper chloride that PCDFs are mainly formed via catalytic reactions of copper compounds and carbon. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Combustion experiments in a laboratory-scale fluiclized-bed reactor were performed to elucidate the effects of combustion temperature on PCDD/Fs formation during incineration of model wastes with poly(vinyl chloride) or sodium chloride as a chlorine source and copper chloride as a catalyst. Each temperature of primary and secondary combustion zones in the reactor was set independently to 700, 800, and 900 degreesC using external electric heaters. The PCDD/Fs concentration is reduced as the temperature of the secondary combustion zone increases. It is effective to keep the temperature of the secondary combustion zone high enough to reduce their release during the waste incineration. On the other hand, as the temperature of the primary combustion zone rises, the PCDD/Fs concentration also increases. Lower temperature of the primary combustion zone results in less PCDD/Fs concentration in these experimental conditions, This result is probably related to the devolatilization rate of the solid waste in the primary combustion zone. The temperature decrease slows the devolatilization rate and promotes mixing of oxygen and volatile matters from the solid waste. This contributes to completing combustion reactions, resulting in reducing the PCDD/Fs concentration."

                        "en": "The difference of polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) isomer patterns between stoker type incinerators and some fluidized bed incinerators (FBI) is a key to understand the formation mechanisms in both types of incinerators. The total yield and the isomer patterns of PCDF, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCN), and polychlorinated benzenes (PCBz) formed via de novo synthesis from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) indicate that chlorinated aromatics in the FBI are formed as a result of PAH breakdown.\nThe detailed analysis of the isomer patterns of PCDF, PCB and PCN gives a first insight into the transformation mechanism of the PAHs and the sequence of degradation, chlorination and oxygen insertion. The major chlorination takes part at the position of the C-C cleavage during degradation of the PAHs. Further chlorination of the hydrogen position of the former PAH takes part preferably in ortho-position to this chlorination or is directed by incorporated oxygen. A perylene structure in soot is proposed as basis for the observed PCDF pattern in the FBI.\nPolychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated phenols (PxCP) were formed in lower concentrations from the de novo experiments indicating an additional formation pathway for these compounds in the FBI.
