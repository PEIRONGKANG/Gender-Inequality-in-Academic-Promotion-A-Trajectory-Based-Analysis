                        "en": "The present study examined characteristics of the acquisition of the concept of size, both concrete and abstract, by children with autism who were at an early level of language development. For concrete concepts, paired dolls, for example, father and baby (task 3), and paired words, such as \"father\" and \"baby\" (task 2) were presented. For abstract concepts, paired word, such as \"big\" and \"small\" (task 1) were presented. In tasks 1 and 2, the children were instructed to select the big one. Participants in the study were 18 pre-school children with autism (mean CA 4.5 years; mean developmental age, 3.1 years; mean developmental quotient, 69), 44 school-aged children with autism (mean CA 14.5 years; mean developmental age, 3.9 years; mean developmental quotient, 27), and 2 comparison groups of children with intellectual disabilities (12 younger children, mean CA 5.1, mean developmental age 3.0 years; and 20 older children, mean CA 14.1 years, mean developmental age, 3.5 years). On the 3 tasks, the preschool children with autism tended to respond like the children with mental retardation. In contrast, the school-aged children with autism not only did worse, generally speaking, than the other 3 groups on the 3 tasks, but also showed a characteristic pattern of responses. For several of the children in the school-aged group with autism, task 2 was more difficult than task 1. Furthermore, on each task, they tended to say the name of the presented object, rather than selecting the big circle or the big doll. This tendency is likely to make it difficult for school-aged children with autism to acquire the concept of size."
