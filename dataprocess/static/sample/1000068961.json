                        "en": "We investigated long-term variations in dissolved chemical species in water sampled from the Sagami River and its tributaries, Japan. The samples were taken monthly from May 1993 to April 2000 at 28 sampling sites in the Sagami River system. In this paper, we concentrate on 17 sites in the upper catchment. Twenty-four major to trace elements (Li, Mg, Al, Ca, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Me, Ag, Cd, Sb, Cs, Ba, W, Tl, Pb, U) were determined by using conventional Q-pole ICP-MS with direct nebulizalion. Water flux was measured from 1995. The data for most species were subjected to fast Fourier transformation (FFT) to extract dominant periodicities, their magnitudes, and their phases. Clear seasonal variations were observed for Al, V, As, Rb and Cs at some sampling points, especially in the tributaries. The seasonal variations may be due to either anthropogenic causes, such as irrigation or wastewater discharge, or natural causes, such as water temperature, pH, redox condition, water flux, or activity of microorganisms. We found no correlation with pH. Water temperature may not be a main controlling factor, although the seasonal variability would be correlated with it. Hydrologic factors may have only minor effects. We suggest that most of the seasonal variation might be correlated with the irrigation of rice paddies. It was difficult to identify all the causes of the seasonal variability. To investigate interannual trends, we used centered 12-month moving averages to eliminate seasonal variations. The water quality of the uppermost streams was generally constant, being controlled by springs on Mt. Fuji. However, in 1993 and 1998, V, As, Rb, Cs and U were depleted briefly, possibly by dilution by overflow from Lakes Kawaguchi and Yamanaka. Hydrologic factors may be more important for interannual variability than seasonal variability. Some heavy trace elements (Zn, Ni, Cd and Sb) showed very irregular variations with high concentration peaks. These elements were discharged from either factories or abandoned mine tailings.

                        "en": "We investigated long-term variations in dissolved chemical species in water sampled from the Sagami River and its tributaries, Japan. The samples were taken monthly from May 1993 to April 2000 at 28 sampling sites in the Sagami River system. In this paper, we concentrate on 17 sites in the upper catchment. Twenty-four major to trace elements (Li, Mg, Al, Ca, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Me, Ag, Cd, Sb, Cs, Ba, W, Tl, Pb, U) were determined by using conventional Q-pole ICP-MS with direct nebulizalion. Water flux was measured from 1995. The data for most species were subjected to fast Fourier transformation (FFT) to extract dominant periodicities, their magnitudes, and their phases. Clear seasonal variations were observed for Al, V, As, Rb and Cs at some sampling points, especially in the tributaries. The seasonal variations may be due to either anthropogenic causes, such as irrigation or wastewater discharge, or natural causes, such as water temperature, pH, redox condition, water flux, or activity of microorganisms. We found no correlation with pH. Water temperature may not be a main controlling factor, although the seasonal variability would be correlated with it. Hydrologic factors may have only minor effects. We suggest that most of the seasonal variation might be correlated with the irrigation of rice paddies. It was difficult to identify all the causes of the seasonal variability. To investigate interannual trends, we used centered 12-month moving averages to eliminate seasonal variations. The water quality of the uppermost streams was generally constant, being controlled by springs on Mt. Fuji. However, in 1993 and 1998, V, As, Rb, Cs and U were depleted briefly, possibly by dilution by overflow from Lakes Kawaguchi and Yamanaka. Hydrologic factors may be more important for interannual variability than seasonal variability. Some heavy trace elements (Zn, Ni, Cd and Sb) showed very irregular variations with high concentration peaks. These elements were discharged from either factories or abandoned mine tailings.

The sampling had been done monthly from May 1993 to April 1999 at 30 sampling sites of Sagami River water system. Twenty-four major to trace elements (Li, Mg, Al, Ca, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, Cs, Ba, W, Tl, Pb, U) were determined using conventional Q-pole ICP-MS with direct nebulization. Chemical oxygen demand, alkalinity, pH, EC were also determined. The data accumulated for 6 years (except Ca, Fe, Ag, W, Tl) were examined using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to extract dominant periodisities, their magnitudes and phases. Clear seasonal variations (12 months period) were observed for many elements at many sampling points especially at down stream area. Aluminum, Cs, V had concentration maxima in summer, while Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn, Mo, U had maxima in winter. On the other hand, Sr and Ba scarcely showed seasonal variation. It can be considered that the seasonal variations may be caused by either anthropogenic origin such as irrigation, wastewater discharge from industry or natural reason such as water temperature, pH, redox condition, water flux, activity of micro-organism in the water. In some cases, we found strong correlation with irrigation condition, water flux (Ni, Mo at down stream area) . In another case, activity of micro-organism could control the variation (Ni at down stream of reservoir, Lake Sagami and Tsukui) . However, we did not find any correlation with pH, and water temperature may not be a main controlling factor. Thus it is difficult to explain the seasonal variations of all elements with single factor. Even the same element at different sampling site may have different factor (s) of variation."

Twenty-four major to trace elements (Li, Mg, Al, Ca, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, Cs, Ba, W, Tl, Pb, U) were determined using conventional Q-pole ICP-MS with direct nebulization. Chemical oxygen demand, alkalinity, pH, EC were also determined. The data accumulated for 6 years (except Ca, Fe, Ag, W, Tl) were examined using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to extract dominant periodisities, their magnitudes and phases. Clear seasonal variations (12 months period) were observed for many elements at many sampling points especially at down stream area. Aluminum, Cs, V had concentration maxima in summer, while Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn, Mo, U had maxima in winter. On the other hand, Sr and Ba scarcely showed seasonal variation. It can be considered that the seasonal variations may be caused by either anthropogenic origin such as irrigation, wastewater discharge from industry or natural reason such as water temperature, pH, redox condition, water flux, activity of micro-organism in the water. In some cases, we found strong correlation with irrigation condition, water flux (Ni, Mo at down stream area) . In another case, activity of micro-organism could control the variation (Ni at down stream of reservoir, Lake Sagami and Tsukui) . However, we did not find any correlation with pH, and water temperature may not be a main controlling factor. Thus it is difficult to explain the seasonal variations of all elements with single factor. Even the same element at different sampling site may have different factor (s) of variation."

The sampling had been done monthly from May 1993 to April 1999 at 14 sampling sites of upper stream of Sagami River water system (Katsura River) . Twenty-four major to trace elements (Li, Mg, Al, Ca, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, Cs, Ba, W, Tl, Pb, U) were determined using conventional Q-pole ICP-MS with direct nebulization. Electric Conductivity, pH, water flux (from April 1995) were also determined. Long-term interannual trends of dissolved species were examined for the data accumulated for 6 years by 12 months moving average.<BR>Water qualities of uppermost stream area were generally constant and mostly controlled by spring waters, which are located around Mt. Fuji. However, in 1998, some elements such as V Rb, Cs were depleted temporally, which may be caused by dilution effect of over flow from Lake Kawaguchi and Lake Yamanaka.<BR>On the other hand, in the small creeks with minor influence of spring waters, many elements such as Ni, Zn, Cd, Sb showed long-term trends. These trends may be caused by either factory or mining wastewaters. Moving averages of some elements, like V, As, Rb, showed concentration maxima during 1995 to 1996. These trends may correlate with water flux.<BR>In the tributaries of Katsura River with wider catchments, many elements such as V, Mn, Rb, Cs showed seasonal variations. The moving averages of most of the elements were generally constant, however, Mg, Ca showed slight decreasing trend and correlated with water flux. In some cases, Co, Ni, Mo etc.showed spiky increases indicating point source origin.<BR>Because intake and discharge of water utility for electric power plant, water quality of mainstream of upper area alters depending on sampling sites."
