                        "en": "PURPOSE: To compare macular thickness and best, corrected visual acuity (BcVA) before and after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) in patients with severe diabetic retinopathy and good visual acuity (VA) to identify factors that predict post-operative visual function. DESIGN: Prospective, non-comparative, interventional case series.\nMETHODS: Sixty-four consecutive patients with severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or with non-high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy whose VA was 20/20 or better before PRP were studied. Sixty-four eyes of 64 patients underwent scatter PRP in four sessions every other week. Macular thickness was measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and VA was measured before and periodically after PRP.\nRESULTS: During the 24-week observation period, patients were classified into three groups according to changes in VA during the post-operative period. In group A, VA was maintained at pre-operative levels in 54 (84%) eyes during the 24 weeks after PRP. In group B, VA initially decreased in three eyes but subsequently recovered to baseline during the observation period; in group C, VA did not recover during follow-up in seven eyes. There was no significant difference in pre-operative foveal thicknesses among the three groups, but parafoveal thickness was &lt; 260 mu m in group A, ranged from 270 to 280 mu m in group B, and was &gt; 300 mu m in group C.\nCONCLUSION: For eyes with severe diabetic retinopathy and good VA, PRP did not affect post,operative VA in more than 80% of patients. Patients whose pre-operative parafoveal thickness was &gt; 300 mu m had a worse visual prognosis."

DESIGN: Prospective, non-comparative, interventional case series.\nMETHODS: Sixty-four consecutive patients with severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or with non-high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy whose VA was 20/20 or better before PRP were studied. Sixty-four eyes of 64 patients underwent scatter PRP in four sessions every other week. Macular thickness was measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and VA was measured before and periodically after PRP.\nRESULTS: During the 24-week observation period, patients were classified into three groups according to changes in VA during the post-operative period. In group A, VA was maintained at pre-operative levels in 54 (84%) eyes during the 24 weeks after PRP. In group B, VA initially decreased in three eyes but subsequently recovered to baseline during the observation period; in group C, VA did not recover during follow-up in seven eyes. There was no significant difference in pre-operative foveal thicknesses among the three groups, but parafoveal thickness was &lt; 260 mu m in group A, ranged from 270 to 280 mu m in group B, and was &gt; 300 mu m in group C.\nCONCLUSION: For eyes with severe diabetic retinopathy and good VA, PRP did not affect post,operative VA in more than 80% of patients. Patients whose pre-operative parafoveal thickness was &gt; 300 mu m had a worse visual prognosis."

The clinical features were characterized by the visual acuity, slit,lamp biomicroscopy, electroretinography, fluorescein angiography, and kinetic visual field testing.\nRESULTS: An identical IVS6 to 8deITCATACAGGTCATCGCG/insGC mutation in the CYP4V2 gene was identified in five of the patients with BCD; the sixth patient had a novel Trp340X mutation in the CYP4V2 gene. Three patients showed crystalline-like deposits at the limbus by specular microscopy. Ophthalmic findings of all patients had a rapid progression after age 50 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the IVS6 to 8delTCATACAGGTCATCGCG/insGC mutation is a common mutation in Japanese patients with BCD. Although phenotypic variability was found, the natural course was almost the same in all of our patients. &COPY; 2005 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Each eye was tested separately, and each stimulus magnitude (intensity X duration) was presented three times. Three catch trials per eye also were presented.\nResults: Scores ranged from -8 to -1 on variable-duration tests and from 22.5 to 37.5 dB on fixed-duration tests for four children with hand movement vision. Scores ranged from -12 to 0 on variable-duration tests and from 12.5 to 40 dB on fixed-duration tests for five children with light perception vision. Reliable measurements were obtained at different times on different days. Mean scores for children with counting finger vision or better were significantly better than scores for eyes with light perception and hand movement (P &lt;.001 and P &lt;.01, respectively). Reliability was less for children younger than age 4 years.\nConclusions: The LoVE is capable of grading the visual function of children with light perception and hand movement vision into finer steps. Reliable measurements can be obtained for children age 4 years and older."

Three patients showed crystalline-like deposits at the limbus by specular microscopy. Ophthalmic findings of all patients had a rapid progression after age 50 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the IVS6 to 8delTCATACAGGTCATCGCG/insGC mutation is a common mutation in Japanese patients with BCD. Although phenotypic variability was found, the natural course was almost the same in all of our patients. &COPY; 2005 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Each eye was tested separately, and each stimulus magnitude (intensity X duration) was presented three times. Three catch trials per eye also were presented.\nResults: Scores ranged from -8 to -1 on variable-duration tests and from 22.5 to 37.5 dB on fixed-duration tests for four children with hand movement vision. Scores ranged from -12 to 0 on variable-duration tests and from 12.5 to 40 dB on fixed-duration tests for five children with light perception vision. Reliable measurements were obtained at different times on different days. Mean scores for children with counting finger vision or better were significantly better than scores for eyes with light perception and hand movement (P &lt;.001 and P &lt;.01, respectively). Reliability was less for children younger than age 4 years.\nConclusions: The LoVE is capable of grading the visual function of children with light perception and hand movement vision into finer steps. Reliable measurements can be obtained for children age 4 years and older."

                        "en": "The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and function of G-substrate, a specific substrate of the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) signaling pathway, in normal rat retina and in G-substrate knockout mice. The retinas of adult wild-type rats and mice and G-substrate knockout mice were studied immunohistologically to characterize the upstream and downstream components of the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway. Immunoblot analysis showed that the molecular weight of retinal G-substrate was similar to that of cerebellar G-substrate. In adult rats and mice, retinal G-substrate was located in a subpopulation of amacrine cells and in C38-positive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) but not in alpha RGCs. In addition, retinal G-substrate was co-expressed with other upstream and downstream signaling components of the NO-cGMP-PKG-G-substrate-phosphatase pathway in the adult retina. Electroretinographic (ERG) analysis demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the ERGs of wild-type and G-substrate knockout mice. These results suggest that retinal G-substrate plays a role as a downstream component of the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway. The co-localization of retinal G-substrate with protein Ser/Thr phosphatases suggests that it acts as an endogenous protein phosphatase inhibitor as in the cerebellum. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

                        "en": "The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and function of G-substrate, a specific substrate of the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) signaling pathway, in normal rat retina and in G-substrate knockout mice. The retinas of adult wild-type rats and mice and G-substrate knockout mice were studied immunohistologically to characterize the upstream and downstream components of the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway. Immunoblot analysis showed that the molecular weight of retinal G-substrate was similar to that of cerebellar G-substrate. In adult rats and mice, retinal G-substrate was located in a subpopulation of amacrine cells and in C38-positive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) but not in alpha RGCs. In addition, retinal G-substrate was co-expressed with other upstream and downstream signaling components of the NO-cGMP-PKG-G-substrate-phosphatase pathway in the adult retina. Electroretinographic (ERG) analysis demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the ERGs of wild-type and G-substrate knockout mice. These results suggest that retinal G-substrate plays a role as a downstream component of the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway. The co-localization of retinal G-substrate with protein Ser/Thr phosphatases suggests that it acts as an endogenous protein phosphatase inhibitor as in the cerebellum. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

CSF-CXCL10/IP-10 and CSF-CCL17/TARC were significantly elevated in VKH than in controls. In the majority of VKH cases and controls, CSF-CXCL10 was higher than serum-CXCL10, and CSF-CCL17 was lower than serum-CCL17. CCL11/Eotaxin was not different between groups. CSF-CCL2/MCP-1 was significantly lower in VKH than in control. The changes in VKH were essentially similar to those in multiple sclerosis, a known Th1-dominant condition. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

CSF-CXCL10/IP-10 and CSF-CCL17/TARC were significantly elevated in VKH than in controls. In the majority of VKH cases and controls, CSF-CXCL10 was higher than serum-CXCL10, and CSF-CCL17 was lower than serum-CCL17. CCL11/Eotaxin was not different between groups. CSF-CCL2/MCP-1 was significantly lower in VKH than in control. The changes in VKH were essentially similar to those in multiple sclerosis, a known Th1-dominant condition. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
