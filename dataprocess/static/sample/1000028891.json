                        "en": "In accretionary prisms formed in subduction zones, accreted sediments deform due to the drag of the subducting plate, resulting in arc-normal compression. In the Cascadia and eastern Nankai subduction zones, however, arc-parallel normal faults, which indicate the occurrence of arc-normal extension, have been observed at the rear of the accretionary prisms. In this study, the deformation caused by the subducting plate in the accretionary prism is calculated using a simple fluid model that considers temperature-dependent rheology. The qualitative results show that a circulating flow is induced by the subducting plate under a lid formed at the rear of the accretionary prisms at higher temperatures, while, in lower-temperature prisms, the flow pattern is analogous to a simple corner flow, and the circulating flow is not induced. Prism materials flow trenchward just under the lid, and this return flow may be the cause of the arc-normal extension observed in the accretionary prisms. Most of the subduction velocity is accommodated by ductile deformation at the rear of the accretionary prisms, resulting in lower seismic coupling at the deeper interplate megathrusts. In the frontal part of the accretionary prisms, where imbricate thrusts develop, low rigidity due to high porosity and pore fluid pressure in the compacting sediment, together with higher concentrations of clay minerals with low frictional coefficients, probably prevents seismic slip at the interplate megathrusts. Locked zones develop between the extensional and imbricate thrust regions in the subduction zones. For low-temperature prisms, locked zones are located arc side of the imbricate thrust region. The fore-arc basin is thus formed above the locked zone in accretionary prisms. In the eastern Nankai subduction zone, another locked zone is estimated to be located in the lower crust. The location of the arc side of the imbricate thrust region in the western and central Nankai subduction zones may be controlled by the thrust intersection with the top of the lower crust and the splay-fault, respectively.

                        "en": "Thermal information of volcanoes is crucial for understanding their magmatic activity. In active volcanoes, the fumarole temperature is measured in order to monitor the magmatic activity In this study, a consumer digital camera has been used as an infrared thermometer in order to obtain the infrared images for a fumarole area in the active crater of the Aso volcano, Japan. the temperature of the fumaroles that are more than a few centimeters in diameter can be estimated from the recorded images The aperture value and the exposure time of the digital camera can be optimized manually, and clear images can be obtained in a wider temperature range of fumaroles by using the digital camera than by the consumer camcorder used in the previous study The spatial resolution can also be chosen by changing the lens. The sensor of the digital cameras is sensitive to the near-infrared wavelengths of light, and the temperature estimation by using light of these wavelengths is robust against disturbances such as atmospheric absorption. The temperature, size, and spatial distribution of the fumaroles estimated by using this thermometer are considered to be more reliable than those measured by the dedicated thermometer used in the Aso volcano and the consumer camcorder used in the previous study The thermometer used in this study is handy and cost-effective. Moreover, it has better temperature and spatial resolutions for monitoring high-temperature volcanic activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Recent seismic observations have shown that low-frequency earthquakes occur in nonvolcanic regions in subduction zones in southwest Japan and Cascadia, and it is suggested that an aqueous fluid released from the subducting lithosphere is necessary for the occurrence of these earthquakes. In a mantle wedge under a subduction zone, a permeable network is likely created by hydrofracturing due to continuous fluid release from the subducting lithosphere. The migration of aqueous fluid through a permeable network is governed by the pressure gradient resulting from the viscous mantle flow that is induced by the subducting oceanic lithosphere. Calculations of the streamlines of the aqueous fluid in the mantle wedge under the subduction zones show that the fluid released from the subducting crust migrates toward the corner of the mantle wedge. The convergence of the aqueous fluid toward the corner of the mantle wedge results in the accumulation of the aqueous fluid near the wedge corner. Due to the propagation of fluid-filled cracks under the effect of buoyancy, the accumulated fluid may easily migrate upward in the overlying lithosphere and along the plate interface. The propagation of fluid-filled cracks from the region containing the accumulated fluid is likely to be the cause of deep low-frequency earthquakes occurring near the corner of the mantle wedge in these subduction zones.

                        "en": "The Beppu graben is located at the eastern end of the Beppu-Shimabara rift zone in the southwest Japan subduction zone. The focal distribution of the earthquakes that have occurred in this graben shows that the cut-off depth of the earthquakes increases with the distance from the Mt. Tsurumi volcano, which is considered to reflect the temperature structure affected by a high-temperature magma body under the volcano. In this study, the temperature structure in this graben is estimated, which shows that the cut-off depth coincides with the isotherm of 350-400 degrees C and that the depth and diameter of the magma body are 79 km and 1-2 km, respectively. The obtained cut-off temperature agrees with that of the brittle-ductile transition of the crust, and the earthquakes are probably triggered by the fluids migrated from the magma body into the brittle crust under active stretching. There is an active seismic cluster in the eastern flank of the volcano near the southern border fault of this graben: the focal distribution of the seismic cluster shows a northward-dipping planar shape. In the beginning of the seismic burst in the seismic cluster, the hypocenters migrated eastward, suggesting the infiltration of fluids through a fault. The seismic cluster is located in an area with a higher subsidence rate in this graben. The seismicity was probably caused by the incursion of magma-derived fluids into an active fault with a high dislocation rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Frictional coupling at the plate interface will control seismicity and tectonics in subduction zones. In this study temperature structure and deformation in the accretionary prism in the Southwest Japan subduction zone are simulated using a two-dimensional isoviscous corner flow model. Using surface heat flow data the average interplate frictional stress and the effective viscosity of the prism are estimated to be 2~30MPa and 10(20~21) Pa·s, respectively. The low stress value is probably due to high pore pressures caused by dehydration reactions in the subducting crust. Estimated temperature of the landward limit of the seismogenic zone is 350~500°C\n when the frictional stress is considered, the temperature becomes ~100°C higher than that of the onset of plasticity of granitic rocks (350°C). The brittle-plastic transition of gabbroic rocks might control the depth extent of the seismogenic zone in lower crustal depths. Flow velocity at the bottom of the prism is estimated to be ~0.01m/yr, indicating that ~25% of the conversion has been consumed by the deformation of the accretionary prism in this subduction zone."

Numerical simulation suggests that temperature at the surface of such a young subducting plate is high enough for partial melting both of the subducting sediments and oceanic crust at the beginning of the subduction. High-Mg andesite magmas were likely to be produced by interaction between silicic slab melts and the overlying mantle wedge. HMA magmas may be commonly produced in the Archean subduction zones under relatively high mantle temperature conditions, contributing to making continental crusts."

                        "en": "We present 35 new heat flow measurements for the Kinki district in the eastern part of the southwest Japan are. Heat flow distribution in this region shows zonal structure parallel to the trench. In the across-are heat flow profile there are two high heat flow peaks: one is located at the volcanic front and the other is between the south coast of this are and the trench. The high heat flow at the volcanic front is probably caused by the induced flow in the mantle wedge. The high heat flow off the south coast is located in the zone where slab depth is 10 similar to 20 km, and is immediately to the ocean side of the boundary at which P-wave velocity increases landward in the upper crust. We thus consider the high heat flow is caused by the uplift of accreted materials along the backstop in the accretionary prism, assuming that seismic velocity is an indicator of rigidity of rocks. The upward flow velocity is estimated to be similar to 1 mm/yr using a simple one-dimensional erosion model, which is consistent with that estimated from the present heights of marine terraces."

Using the measured heat generation value, together with the published heat generation data of a granitic body emplaced in this section, vertical profile of heat generation in the crust is constructed. The estimated heat generation profile shows steep decrease with depth, but is not lower than a value of similar to 1.0 mu W/m(3) in the upper crust. In the lower crust metabasites are dominant, and heat generation value is one order of magnitude lower than that in the upper crust. Surface heat flow derived from the crustal heat generation is estimated to be similar to 25 mW/m(2). When the crustal heat generation is considered, temperature at the bottom of the crust estimated from surface heat flow becomes similar to 300 degrees C lower. This temperature difference corresponds to the viscosity variation of more than three orders of magnitude, which is important for understanding lithosphere dynamics."

The estimated profile shows that heat generation steeply decreases with depth. Using the exponential model the thickness of the layer with relatively high heat generation is estimated to be 7±2 km\n this thickness is in the range of those estimated in heat flow provinces on continents. It is considered that this upward concentration of heat generation is caused by magmatic processes such as the gravitational differentiation in the magma chamber. In the upper crust of evolving arcs, where the continental‐type crust is growing, magmatic processes in chambers of granitic magmas could be important for the upward concentration of heat generation.

Numerical modeling of the thermal structure implies that the hypocenters are located along isotherms of 500° to 550°C, which is consistent with the hypothesis that deep earthquakes result from the phase transition of metastable olivine to a high-pressure phase in the subducting slab."

When the temperature of the core of the slab at depths of 300∼350 km is higher than the kinetic cut‐off temperature of the olivine‐spinel phase transformation, there is no seismicity maximum in the slab below that depth range. When the temperature of the core of the slab at 300∼350 km depths is lower than the kinetic cut‐off temperature, there is a depth range of relatively high seismic activity in the slabs. Moreover, estimated temperature in the depth range of relatively high seismicity is near the kinetic cut‐off temperature. It is inferred that the phase transformation of meta‐stable olivine triggers deep earthquakes and causes high seismic activity below the depths of 300∼350 km in relatively low temperature slabs, when the phase transformation is the cause of deep earthquakes. In relatively high temperature slabs, however, it is considered that the phase transformation occurs in nearly equilibrium conditions and meta‐stable olivine does not exist. Other mechanisms in addition to the phase transformation are required to explain observed deep seismicity especially in relatively high temperature slabs.

                        "en": "Frictional coupling at the plate interface will control seismicity and tectonics in subduction zones. In this study temperature structure and deformation in the accretionary prism in the Southwest Japan subduction zone are simulated using a two-dimensional isoviscous corner flow model. Using surface heat flow data the average interplate frictional stress and the effective viscosity of the prism are estimated to be 2 similar to 30MPa and 10(20-21)Pa.s, respectively. The low stress value is probably due to high pore pressures caused by dehydration reactions in the subducting crust. Estimated temperature of the landward limit of the seismogenic zone is 350 similar to 500 degrees C; when the frictional stress is considered, the temperature becomes similar to 100 degrees C higher than that of the onset of plasticity of granitic rocks (350 degrees C). The brittle-plastic transition of gabbroic rocks might control the depth extent of the seismogenic zone in lower crustal depths. Flow velocity at the bottom of the prism is estimated to be similar to 0.01m/yr, indicating that similar to 25% of the conversion has been consumed by the deformation of the accretionary prism in this subduction zone."

Numerical simulation suggests that temperature at the surface of such a young subducting plate is high enough for partial melting both of the subducting sediments and oceanic crust at the beginning of the subduction. High-Mg andesite magmas were likely to be produced by interaction between silicic slab melts and the overlying mantle wedge. HMA magmas may be commonly produced in the Archean subduction zones under relatively high mantle temperature conditions, contributing to making continental crusts."

The estimated profile shows that heat generation steeply decreases with depth. Using the exponential model the thickness of the layer with relatively high heat generation is estimated to be 7+/-2 km; this thickness is in the range of those estimated in heat flow provinces on continents. It is considered that this upward concentration of heat generation is caused by magmatic processes such as the gravitational differentiation in the magma chamber. In the upper crust of evolving arcs, where the continental-type crust is growing, magmatic processes in chambers of granitic magmas could be important for the upward concentration of heat generation."

                        "en": "A double seismic zone for deep earthquakes was found in the Izu-Bonin region. An analysis of SP-converted phases confirms that the deep seismic zone consists of two layers separated by approximately 20 kilometers. Numerical modeling of the thermal structure implies that the hypocenters are located along isotherms of 500-degrees to 550-degrees-C, which is consistent with the hypothesis that deep earthquakes result from the phase transition of metastable olivine to a high-pressure phase in the subducting slab."
