                        "en": "A demonstration test with the aim to show the potential of ammonia-fired power plant is planned using a micro gas turbine. 50kW class turbine system firing kerosene is selected as a base model. Over 40kW of power generation was achieved by firing ammonia gas only. Over 40kW of power generation was also achieved by firing mixture of ammonia and methane. However ammonia gas supply increases NOx in the exhaust gas dramatically. NOx concentration in the exhaust gas of gas turbine reached at over 600ppm. In the case of the gas turbine operation firing kerosene-ammonia with 31kW of power generation at 75,000rpm of rotating speed, the LHV (Lower Heating Value) ratio of ammonia to the total supplied fuel was changed from 0% to 100% in detail. NO emission increases rapidly to around 400ppm with ammonia at 7% of LHV ratio of ammonia. Then NO emission increases gradually to 600ppm with ammonia at 27% of LHV ratio of ammonia. NO emission has the peak around 60% of LHV ratio of ammonia. NO emission decreases below 500ppm at 100% of LHV ratio of ammonia. The gas turbine operation firing methane-ammonia with 31kW of power generation at 75,000rpm of rotating speed was also tried. NO emission increases rapidly to around 470ppm with ammonia at 7% of LHV ratio of ammonia. Then NO emission increases gradually to 600ppm with ammonia around 30% of LHV ratio of ammonia. NO emission has the peak at 65% of LHV ratio of ammonia. NO emission decreases below 500ppm at 100% of LHV ratio of ammonia. Since the ammonia flame in the prototype combustor seems to be inhomogeneous, ammonia combustion in the prototype combustor may have high NOx region and low NOx region. Therefore there is a possibility of low-NOx combustion.\nFlame observation was planned to know combustion state for improvement toward the low NOx combustor. Flame observation from the combustor exit was available by extending the combustor exit with the adaptor of the bent coaxial tubes and the quartz window. Swirling flames of ammonia, methane and methane-ammonia were observed near the center axis of the combustor. Flame observation at 39.1kW of power generation was succeeded. In the case of the flame observation, fuel consumption increased due to increase of the heat loss from the combustor. The emissions of NO and NH3 clearly depend on the combustion inlet temperature at 75,000rpm of rotating speed. The emissions of NO and NH3 in the case of the flame observation setting corresponds to the emission in the case of the normal setting at the condition that the power output is 11.2kW lower."

                        "en": "For the first time, NH3-air combustion power generation has been successfully realized using a 50 kW class micro gas turbine system at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan. Based on the global demand for carbon-free power generation as well as recent advances involving gas-turbine technologies, such as heat-regenerative cycles, rapid fuel mixing using strong swirling flows, and NOx reduction using selective catalytic reduction (SCR), allow us to realize NH3-air combustion gas-turbine system, which was abandoned in the 1960's. In the present system, the combustor adopted gaseous NH3 fuel and diffusion combustion to enhance flame stability. The NH3 pre-cracking apparatus for combustion enhancement using generated H-2 was not employed. The NH3-air combustion gas-turbine power generation system can be operated over a wide range of power and rotational speeds, i.e., 18.4 kW to 44.4 kW and 70,000 rpm to 80,000 rpm, respectively. The combustion efficiency of the NH3 -air gas turbine ranged from 89% to 96% at 80,000 rpm. The emission of NO and unburnt NH3 depends on the combustor inlet temperature. Emission data indicates that there are NH3 fuel-rich and fuel-lean regions in the primary combustion zone. It is presumed that unburnt NH3 is released from the fuel-rich region, while NO is released from the fuel-lean region. When diluted air enters the secondary combustion zone, unburnt NH3 is expected to react with NO through selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR). NH3-CH4-air combustion operation tests were also performed and the results show that the increase of the NH3 fuel ratio significantly increases the NO emission, whereas it decreases the NO conversion ratio. To achieve low NOx combustion in NH3-air combustion gas turbines, it is suggested to burn large quantities of NH3 fuel and produce both rich and lean fuel mixtures in the primary combustion zone.

                        "en": "To protect against global warming, a massive influx of renewable energy is expected. Although hydrogen is a renewable media, its storage and transportation in large quantity is difficult. Ammonia, however, is a hydrogen energy carrier and carbon-free fuel, and its storage and transportation technology is already established. Although ammonia combustion was studied in the 1960s in the USA, the development of an ammonia combustion gas turbine had been abandoned because combustion efficiency was unacceptably low. Since that time, in the combustion field, ammonia has been thought of as a fuel N additive in the study of NOx formation. Recent demand for hydrogen carrier revives the usage of ammonia combustion, but no one has attempted an actual design setup for ammonia combustion gas turbine power generation. The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan successfully performed ammonia-kerosene co-fired gas turbine power generation in 2014, and ammonia-fired gas turbine power generation in 2015. In the facilities, a regenerator-heated, diffusion-combustion micro-gas turbine is used, and its high combustor inlet temperature enables high thermal efficiency of ammonia combustion compared with that of methane combustion. Adoption of the regenerator increased combustor inlet temperature and enhanced flame stability in ammonia-air combustion. Although NOx emission from a gas turbine combustor is high, a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) after gas turbine combustor reduces NOx emission to less than 10 ppm. This means that the ammonia combustion gas turbine design, abandoned in the 1960s for its unacceptably low combustion efficiency, has performed successfully with regenerator and SCR technology. However, the weakness of these facilities was that they required large-size SCR equipment in order to suppress a high concentration of NOx. Although NOx reduction in the combustion process is desirable, low NOx combustion technology is difficult because ammonia had been thought of as a source of fuel-NO. In the case of premixed ammonia-air flame, there exists a low emission window of NOx and NH3 in a certain equivalence ratio, but combustion intensity is very low because the laminar burning velocity of NH3-air is one-fifth that of CH4-air. This means that, when utilizing the window of premixed ammonia-air flame, scale-up of the combustion chamber or fuel additives for enhancement of flame stability is necessary. This study shows that the addition of H-2 is effective for low NOx combustion with high combustion efficiency. In addition, H-2 can be easily made from NH3 decomposition. The other option is diffusion combustion. Further research on low NOx combustion is needed."

Silicon nitride ceramic is well known as a typical material for hot components of the gas turbines. In utilizing ceramics as the hot components of gas turbines, foreign object impact damages are the main issue in the ceramic engines. In this study, we examined the critical impact velocity, which resulted in the fracture of the ceramic test pieces. In the experiment, a 1 mm diameter samarium cobalt ball impacted on the type SN282 (Kyocera) silicon nitride ceramic test piece. The test piece was hold under the actual service condition, i.e. the elevated temperatures and the pre-loading tensile loads pertinent to the centrifugal force. The main results so far obtained were: Both the elevated temperature and the pre-loading stress decreased the critical impact velocity lower than that under the room temperature without stress. The effects of the temperature and the stress on decreasing the critical velocity were not simply additive."

In this study, several amounts of yttria were added to zircon powder, and the effect of the yttria addition on the structure and properties of the coatings were evaluated to improve the stability of the zircon coating structure at elevated temperature. The coatings obtained were composed of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), glassy silica, whereas the one prepared from monolithic zircon powder was composed of the metastable high temperature tetragonal phase of zirconia and glassy silica. After the heat treatment over 1200 degrees C, silica and zirconia formed zircon in all coatings. However, coatings with higher amounts of yttria exhibited lower amounts of zircon. This resulted in the less open porosity of the coating at elevated temperature. These yttria-added coatings also showed good adhesion even after the heat treatment, while monolithic zircon coating pealed off."

Especially, the ceramic nozzle vanes can be installed on a metal disk very simply. The disk structure enables us to replace blades with various shape and attack angles. We tried to operate several sets of ceramic components and metal components, such as a set of a ceramic turbine nozzle and an Inconel rotor, etc."

                        "en": "Two kinds of thermoelectric p-type semiconductive epsilon-Zn4Sb3 with different oxygen content were prepared by hot-pressing at 748 K under 49 MPa for 5 h in vacuum, and their transport and thermoelectric properties were evaluated to study the effect of oxygen concentration. The oxygen content of Zn4Sb3 fabricated from high-purity Zn and Sb powders and from a commercially available powder was 0.209% and 0.625%, respectively. Electrical resistance and Seebeck coefficient were evaluated from 323 to 673 K. The electrical resistance of the two Zn4Sb3 samples exhibited a similar linear temperature dependence from room temperature up to about 600 K, except that the resistance of the oxygen-poor Zn4Sb3 was slightly higher. Above 600 K, however, the oxygen-rich Zn4Sb3 showed an irregular downward deviation from linearity, unlike the high-purity sample. This anomalous temperature dependence was examined on the basis of the thermal stability of Zn4Sb3, and could be explained through a mechanism of Zn release and absorption by the Zn4Sb3 lattice at higher temperatures. The Seebeck coefficient showed a temperature dependence similar to that of the electrical resistance, but its absolute value was higher in the case of the oxygen-poor Zn4Sb3. Based on these electrical properties, it was found that the power factor of the oxygen-poor Zn4Sb3 was about 20% higher. On the other hand, the thermal conductivity of the oxygen-poor Zn4Sb3 was higher. Thus, the thermoelectric performance, i.e., the ZT value, of the oxygen-poor Zn4Sb3 was lower at temperatures above 500 K. The oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich compounds attained their maximum ZT maxima (0.93 and 1.08, respectively) at 622 and 660 K, respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

J-850 jet engine (Sophia Precision Co., Ltd.) was chosen as a baseline machine. The turbine nozzle and the rotor are replaced by type SN-01 (Otsuka Ceramics Co., Ltd.) and type SN-235 (Kyocera Corporation) ceramic elements, respectively. By using type 3a engine, we succeeded one-hour running test of the engine without cooling and severe damages. The turbine inlet temperature was higher than 1000 degrees C. The rotating speed was about 120,000 rpm. Performances of the type 3a engine (with ceramic nozzle and rotor) and the type 1 (with Inconel alloy nozzle and ceramic rotor) were compared as follows: At the same rotation speed, turbine inlet temperature of the type 3a became higher than that of the type 1. Simultaneously, fuel consumption of type 3a was larger than that of the type 1. Thrust of the type 3a was slightly larger than that of the type 1. Those results imply that the thermal efficiency of type 3a is slightly, 2%, lower than that of the type 1.\nThe present sealing configurations between ceramic nozzle-vanes and their holder plate and ceramic rotor-housing and metal combustion chamber were found to work well."

                        "en": "A series of operation tests of a ceramic micro gas turbine has been successfully carried out. The baseline machine is a small single-shaft turbojet engine (J-850, Sophia Precision Corp.) with a centrifugal compressor, an annular type combustor, and a radial turbine.\nAs a first step, an Inconel 713C alloy turbine rotor of 55 nun in diameter was replaced with a ceramic rotor (SN-235, Kyocera Corporation). A running test was conducted at rotational speeds of up to 140,000 rpm in atmospheric air. At this rotor speed, the compression pressure ratio and the thrust were 3 and 100 N, respectively. The total energy level (enthalpy and kinetic energy) of the exhaust gas jet was 240 M If, for example, it is assumed that 10% of the total power of the exhaust jet gas was converted into electricity, the present system would correspond to a generator with 24 kW output power. The measured turbine outlet temperature was 950 degrees C (1,740 degrees F) and the turbine inlet temperature was estimated to be 1,280 degrees C (2,340 degrees F). Although the ceramic rotor showed no evidence of degradation, the Inconel nozzle immediately in front of the turbine rotor partially melted in this rotor condition.\nAs a second step, the Inconel turbine nozzle and casing were replaced with ceramic parts (SN-01, Ohtsuka Ceramics Inc.). The ceramic nozzle and case were supported by metal parts. Through tests with the ceramic nozzle, it became evident that one of the key technologies for the development of ceramic gas turbines is the design of the interface between the ceramic components and the metallic components, because the difference between the coefficients of linear thermal expansion of the ceramic and metal produces large thermal stress at their interface in the high-temperature condition. A buffer material made of alumina fiber was therefore introduced at the inter-face between the ceramic and metal."

The coating from mixture had an ordinary lamella structure which consisted of alumina splats and zirconia splats, whereas that from fine powders showed the striped contrast in the splat. X-ray deflection profiles revealed that the latter contained gamma-alumina, monoclinic-zirconia and tetragonal-zirconia crystals, which sizes were under 10 nm. These facts mean the fine crystals dispersed in homogeneously. The nano-composite coating had a higher Vickers hardness and lower thermal diffusivity than the coating from mixture. Moreover, it showed good thermal stability and its crystallite size kept under 50 nm even after the heat treatment at 1500 degrees C for 100h."

The effects of ZrO2 addition and sintering temperature on densification behaviour and mechanical properties were investigated. It is shown that the addition of ZrO2 can effectively inhibit grain growth and significantly accelerate densification. At a sintering temperature of 1580 degreesC, 15 vol.% ZrO2-containing alumina-mullite composites were sintered to 97.4% of the theoretical density. Due to a relatively homogeneous microstructure without large abnormal grains, such composites exhibited a highly intergranular fracture mode. As a result, a high strength up to 575 MPa was obtained.

As the chamber pressure increases, the plasma flame shortens. At the same time, the particle slows down and the particle temperature increases. The multivariate analysis among the spray parameters and the measured values reveal that the particle temperature and the particle velocity can be controlled individually as a function of the chamber pressure and the spray distance. The zirconia coatings were fabricated by controlling the particle temperature and velocity at the impinging upon the substrate individually. Increase of the particle temperature increased the deposition efficiency, the density and the hardness of the coating. On the other hand, increase of the particle velocity up to a certain value also increased them, but the excessive velocity decreased them. Because the shortened dwelling time prevented the powder core from melting, even if the surface was sufficiently heated."

                        "en": "Zircon is widely used as a refractory material, because of its excellent mechanical and chemical proper-ties. Several studies on plasma sprayed zircon were reported since 70's, and it is known that zircon dissociate into silica and zirconia during the plasma spray process. Authors have been studied on plasma sprayed zircon for a protective coating application, and successfully obtained very dense coating with excellent adhesive strength by optimizing the spray parameter. However, it was also revealed that the coating had poor stability above 1500K. In this study, the effects of two different oxides additive (yttria and ceria) on the structure and stability of the plasma sprayed zircon coating above 1500K are evaluated. The addition of these oxides enhanced the amount of residual zirconia and decreased zircon after the heat treatments. Addition of yttria resulted in the coating composed of cubic zirconia and zircon, while monoclinic zirconia was formed by ceria addition."

The atmospheric plasma sprayed matrix layers and wire layers arranged by filament-winding technique were piled up alternately. Though the matrix and the wire were partially bonded only on the side which sprayed particles came flying to, a solid structure was obtained by this technique. Spraying in one direction perpendicular to the substrate made peculiar V-shape pores around the wires, but tilting the torch was effective to reduce the pores. The flexural strength of composite didn't increase in spite of some crack deflections on the fracture surface. Owing to the wire pullout, however, the composite exhibited a remarkably higher apparent fracture energy than that of monolithic alumina ceramics."

Due to the crack deflection at the Al2O3/SiC interfaces, a plateau indentation strength response was achieved, suggesting an exceptional resistance to contact-induced damage. Moreover, fracture toughness was observed to increase from 8.0 to 15.5 MPa m(1/2) with increasing notch depth from 0.5 to 2.0 mm, indicative of a strong R-curve behavior.

                        "en": "We grew single crystals,of partially Bi-substituted Ca3Co4O9 phase in a solution consisting of K2CO3-KCl solvent. All the X-ray diffraction patterns of the single crystals with different Bi contents were attributable to the Ca3Co4O9 structure, although weak diffraction peaks from a secondary phase of Bi2Ca2Co2Ox were observed in the crystals grown front a starting composition molar ratio of Ca : Bi : Co = 2.5 : 0.5 : 4.0 (BC-0.5 crystal). Thermoelectric properties of the crystals in the ab-plane were measured at various temperatures. Seebeck coefficient (S) was increased by the partial Bi-substitution at room temperature, whereas electrical resistivity (p) was decreased at room temperature except for BC-0.5 crystals. The simultaneous increase in S and decrease in p suggest an increase in carrier mobility. Although Bi atoms are heavier than the replaced Ca or Co atoms, the phonon part of thermal conductivity is increased by the Bi-substitution. We suggest that these effects of the Bi-substitution on thermoelectric properties are largely governed by changes in the peculiar crystal structure, such as the misfit relationship between the CoO2 and Ca2CoO3 layers, which constitute the layered structure of the Co3O4O9 phase."

                        "en": "Polymer impregnation pyrolysis method (PIP method) has some advantages to fabricate SiC fiber /SiC composite with large or complex form. However polymer derived SiC contains some amount of excess carbon and porosity. In particular the excess carbon is easy to be oxidized in air at high temperature. Therefore reliability of the composite is not sufficient for long term use, because the oxidized matrix makes strong bonding between the fiber and the matrix. In this study, TiO2 as a reactive filler was added into polymer to consume the excess carbon by chemical reaction. Polycarbosilane (PCS) was used as a precursor polymer to synthesize a SiC matrix. It was confirmed that TiO2 was formed TiC on reaction with PCS over 1673 K by preliminary study SiC fiber, Hi-Nicalon (R), was used as reinforcement. Al2O3 powder was coated on surface of SiC fiber as interface layer of fiber/matrix. TiO2 added PCS/hexane solution was compounded with the fiber tow by filament winding. SiC fiber/SiC composite was synthesized at 1673 K for 3.6 ks in Ar. The composite was densified by reinfiltration of TiO2 added PCS solution and pyrolysis at 1673 K. Though densification behavior of the composite with TiO2 is slower than composite without TiO2, it was suggested that composition of synthesized SiC is close to stoichiometric one by apparent density. Fracture behavior of the composite indicated that addition of TiO2 was increase bonding strength between fiber and matrix. Bending strength of composite was increased after oxidation test at 1473 K for 360 ks in air atmosphere."

                        "en": "Thermoelectric p-type semiconductive epsilon-Zn4Sb3 was hot-pressed at 748 K under 49 MPa for 5 h in vacuum from three kinds of raw powder having different average particle sizes (12.1, 19.5 and 44.3 mu m) in order to study the effect of particle size on electrical and mechanical properties. Electrical resistance and Seebeck coefficient were measured over the temperature range from 323 to 673 K. Of the three powders, the 44.3 mu m powder yielded the lowest electrical resistance epsilon-Zn4Sb3. This was not due to the reduced grain boundary resistance, but rather, the lower oxygen contamination. The Seebeck coefficient showed no distinctive dependence on starting particle size below 600 K. Above this temperature, however, the Zn4Sb3 specimen derived from 44.3 mu m powder exhibited the highest coefficient. Both bending strength and fracture toughness improved by reducing the starting particle size. The 12.1 mu m powder yielded the highest strength (82.7 MPa) and the highest fracture toughness (0.95 MN m(-1.5)). (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Authors have been studied on the effect of the heat treatment on the structure and properties of plasma sprayed zircon coating as a candidate for an environmental barrier coating (EBC). In this study, very dense coating with excellent adhesive strength was successfully obtained by optimizing the spray process. Substrate temperature is one of the dominant factors to control porosity and crack formation in the coating. The higher substrate temperature, obtained by plasma pre-heating, resulted in lower porosity and less cracks. Open porosity of the coating was quite low, about 2%, in the coatings obtained especially above 1473 K of the substrate temperature."

                        "en": "Nano-dispersed α-Al 2O 3/YAG composite coatings were successfully obtained by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) of the granulated Al 2O 3/Y 2O 3 powder and the post heat treatment. The as-sprayed coating was composed of an amorphous phase, metastable Y-Al-O solid solution. After the heat treatment about 1473 K, two crystalline phases, α-Al 2O 3 and YAG, precipitated. So that the fine dispersed α-Al 2O 3/YAG composite coatings were obtained. The sizes of the precipitates could be widely controlled by time and temperature of the post heat treatment. The diameter of both particles was varied from about 10 to 150 nm, depending on the heat treatment time. It was found that crystallization of α-Al 2O 3 and YAG occurred during the heat treatment about 1218 K with huge volume shrinkage. Many cracks were formed in the coatings because of this volume shrinkage during the heat treatment. This affected the wear mechanism in Ball on Disk Test, and caused a fracture in the coatings heat-treated for 1-10 hr. Plasma pre-heating of the substrate before and during the plasma spray process was carried out, in order to keep the substrate temperature about 1423 K for in-situ crystallization. The as-sprayed coating with plasma pre-heating was composed of crystallized α-Al 2O 3 and YAG particles without any cracks. Open porosity of this coating was maintained about 2-3% even after the heat treatment at 1473 K, while the open porosity of the APS coatings increased up to 8%. Anti wear property of the coatings with plasma pre-heating were highly superior to that of the APS coatings even after the heat treatments. © 2005 The Japan Institute of Metals."

                        "en": "Thermoelectric Zn4Sb3 bulk specimens have been fabricated by hot pressing at various temperatures from 738 to 753 K either in a vacuum or under pressurized Ar. The bulk specimens consist of a single-phase p-type semiconductive E-Zn4Sb3 compound. Compositional change due to Zn vaporization, anticipated during the high temperature processes, could be avoided by adding excess Zn to the starting powder. Bulk density, electric resistivity, Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity were evaluated. Observed bulk densities of 6.2-6.4 g/cm(3) exceeded the value of 6.08 g/cm(3) determined from X-ray diffraction data. Electric resistivity decreases with increasing hot-pressing temperature in the range from 323 to 673 K, and exhibits unusual temperature-dependent hysteresis. Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity values were much closer to previously reported data, with only slight differences among specimens measured at various hot-pressing temperatures. A material fabricated in a vacuum at 748 K, had a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) greater than 1, because it had small electric resistivity and thermal conductivity values. Application of a pressurized Ar atmosphere during hot pressing did not contribute to improved thermoelectric performance of Zn4Sb3 compound. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The work-of-fracture of the composites has been improved greatly due to the developed paths for crack propagation by the weak cell boundaries, corresponding to longer displacement under reasonable load-carrying condition. The route of crack propagation depended greatly on the interfacial shear strength and boundary thickness. Crack deflecting and delamination are considered as two main contributions at the earlier stage, whereas frictional sliding of fibrous cells becomes more dominant after cracking occurs, especially at lower loading condition. These mechanisms are different from those observed in multilayered monolithic ceramics due to the controlled structures of present materials. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and Techna S.r.l.

                        "en": "The effects of SiC and B4C additives in the MoSi2 matrix on the microstructures and mechanical properties at room temperature were investigated. Their coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) were also evaluated up to 1200 degreesC by a thermal mechanical analysis (TMA). The experimental results show that the Mo2B5 reinforced phase was formed in situ in the hot-pressed MoSi2/SiC/B4C composites. Both the Mo2B5 phase and the SiC phase significantly improved the mechanical behavior of MoSi2. Besides, the SiC with a high content up to 40 vol% could be added into the MoSi2 composite with the B4C additive. As a result, a dense and homogenous MoSi2/SiC/B4C composite was obtained, which possessed a relatively high bending strength and fracture toughness. Meanwhile, the CTE of the MoSi2/SiC/B4C composites linearly decreased with the increasing SiC content, which dropped to 21% at 1200 degreesC in comparison with the pure MoSi2 when adding 40 vol% SiC. This MoSi2/SiC/B4C composite system is very important for developing new applications at elevated temperature, particularly for high-temperature coating applications.
