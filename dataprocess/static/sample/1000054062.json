                        "en": "Acridine orange (AO), a weakly basic fluorescent dye, is permeable to plasma and vesicle membranes and preferentially remains in intracellular acidic regions. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed dynamic changes in AO-loaded cultured malignant melanoma cells during illumination with blue light. Immediately after the start of the illumination, the successive disruption of vesicles was observed as a flash of fluorescence, and shortly after that, blebs were formed on the plasma membrane. These cells died within 5 min. Vesicle disruption was completely inhibited when cells were treated with the Vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A] followed by loading with AO, but not when bafilomycin A I was treated after AO loading. Thus, the filling of AO in the vesicle, which is driven by vacuolar H+-ATPase, is initially required for vesicle disruption. In contrast, bafilomycin Al did not prevent plasma membrane blebbing, indicating that the blebs are formed independently of the vesicle disruption. Acute cell death was inhibited by treatment with bafilomycin Al before but not after AO loading. Thus, AO- and blue light-induced acute cell death is associated with vesicle disruption rather than bleb formation. Both the vesicle disruption and the formation of plasma membrane blebs were inhibited by removal of oxygen from the cell environment and by singlet oxygen scavengers, sodium azide, ascorbic acid, and L-histidine, but not inhibited by the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethyl thiourea. Acute cell death was also prevented by singlet oxygen scavengers but not by dimethyl thiourea. Thus, these phenomena are likely caused at least in part by the generation of singlet oxygen. The photosensitive features of plasma and vesicle membranes observed in the present study may be based on the use of the photodynamic effect, such as cancer therapy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

                        "en": "Acridine orange (AO), a weakly basic fluorescent dye, is permeable to plasma and vesicle membranes and preferentially remains in intracellular acidic regions. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed dynamic changes in AO-loaded cultured malignant melanoma cells during illumination with blue light. Immediately after the start of the illumination, the successive disruption of vesicles was observed as a flash of fluorescence, and shortly after that, blebs were formed on the plasma membrane. These cells died within 5 min. Vesicle disruption was completely inhibited when cells were treated with the Vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A] followed by loading with AO, but not when bafilomycin A I was treated after AO loading. Thus, the filling of AO in the vesicle, which is driven by vacuolar H+-ATPase, is initially required for vesicle disruption. In contrast, bafilomycin Al did not prevent plasma membrane blebbing, indicating that the blebs are formed independently of the vesicle disruption. Acute cell death was inhibited by treatment with bafilomycin Al before but not after AO loading. Thus, AO- and blue light-induced acute cell death is associated with vesicle disruption rather than bleb formation. Both the vesicle disruption and the formation of plasma membrane blebs were inhibited by removal of oxygen from the cell environment and by singlet oxygen scavengers, sodium azide, ascorbic acid, and L-histidine, but not inhibited by the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethyl thiourea. Acute cell death was also prevented by singlet oxygen scavengers but not by dimethyl thiourea. Thus, these phenomena are likely caused at least in part by the generation of singlet oxygen. The photosensitive features of plasma and vesicle membranes observed in the present study may be based on the use of the photodynamic effect, such as cancer therapy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

                        "en": "The majority of research for the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the stomach has been devoted to the submucosal blood flow, and only slight attention has been paid to its involvement in the gastric epithelial function. In this study, we examined the age-related change in the CGRP-containing nerves and its effects on the mucus metabolism. We compared the immunoreactivity for CGRP in the gastric mucosa of 7-week-old rats (young) to that of 52-week-old animals (middle-aged). The effects of CGRP on the mucin biosynthesis were compared using the stomachs from both young and middle-aged rats. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was measured in the surface and deep mucosa of the gastric corpus. The density of the CGRP nerve fibers was reduced in both the lamina propria and submucosa of the middle-aged rats compared to the young rats. CGRP stimulated the mucin biosynthesis in the cultured corpus mucosa from the 7-week-old rats, but not from the 52-week-old rats. The total NOS activity of the surface layer in the corpus mucosa was markedly reduced in the middle-aged rats compared to the young rats. These findings demonstrate the age-dependent reduction in the CGRP-induced mucin biosynthesis, as well as in the density of the CGRP fibers in the rat stomach. The decreased NOS activity in the surface layer of the oxyntic mucosa in the aged rats may also be a principal cause for the lack of regulation of the mucin biosynthesis by CGRP.

In the present study, the effects of soluble laminin on organelle transport and their relation to neurite growth were investigated in cultured dissociated mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Laminin added into the extracellular medium was deposited on the surface of DRG neurons. DRG neurons incubated with soluble laminin exhibited branched, long, and thin neurites. Time-lapse study demonstrated that many small-diameter branches were newly formed after the addition of laminin. Thus, the growths of large-diameter primary neurites, arising from cell bodies and branches extended from growth cones of primary neuritis, were analyzed separately. Laminin decreased the growth rate of primary neurites but increased that of branches. In primary neurites, acute addition of laminin rapidly decreased organelle movement in the neurite shaft and growth cone, accompanied by slowing of the growth cone advance. Branching of primary neurites occurred in response to laminin in some growth cones. In these growth cones, organelles protruded into nascent branches, In branches, soluble laminin increased organelle movement in the growth cone and the distal portion of the shaft. These results suggest that laminin inhibits the elongation of primary neurites but promotes branching and elongation of branches, all of which seem to be closely related to organelle transport."

                        "en": "Background and Objectives: Clinical and laboratory studies suggest that lidocaine is more neurotoxic than bupivacaine. However, histological evidence of their comparative neurotoxicity is sparse. We thus pathologically and functionally compared the intrathecal neurotoxicity of these agents.\nMethods: Rats received 0.12 mu L/g body weight lidocaine (0%, 2%, 10%, or 20%) or bupivacaine (0%, 0.5%, 2.5%, or 5%) in distilled water via an intrathecal catheter. The influence of high osmolarity was also examined using 5% bupivacaine in 20% glucose solution (5% BG) and a control 2 5% glucose solution. The L3 spinal cord, the posterior and anterior roots, and the cauda equina were examined by light and electron microscopy. Walking behavior and sensory threshold were investigated as neurofunctional tests.\nResults: The posterior root and posterior white matter showed axonal degeneration in rats treated with 10% and 20% lidocaine and 5% bupivacaine in distilled water (5% BDW) and in 5% BG, but not in rats treated with 2% lidocaine, 0.5% and 2.5% bupivacaine, distilled water, or 25% glucose solution. The histological damages were more severe in 20% lidocaine-treated rats than in 5% bupivacaine-treated rats. The damage of posterior white matter was observed only when the posterior root was severely injured. No significant difference of histological findings was observed between 5% BDW and 5% BG. Functional abnormalities were found only in rats treated with 20% lidocaine.\nConclusions: The neurotoxic lesions caused by bupivacaine and lidocaine were indistinguishable in the primary site and the extending pattern, such as axonal degeneration originating from the posterior roots and extending to the posterior white matter. The intrathecal neurotoxicity is greater in lidocaine than in bupivacaine."
