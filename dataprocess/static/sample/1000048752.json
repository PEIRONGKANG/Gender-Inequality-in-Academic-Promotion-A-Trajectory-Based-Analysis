Such transformation and its inverse one seem to be formal extension of complex Fourier transform of two dimensional system.

In our experiment, PIC microcontroller generates ultrasonic tone burst and measures the pendulum position from the time interval between ultrasonic emission and sent back another frequency ultrasonic tone burst reception. From the acquired pendulum position data, the PIC generates the control commands for the pendulum swing center position movement. By the suitable control of the swing center horizontal movement, the pendulum swing amplitude could be made growth or decay rapidly."

Then, an example of numerical experiments was described to show the usefulness of this method. Those results indicated that our method has the effect like as anti-aliasing filter. This effect may have advantage in case of appling compact devices with simple hardware. It would be especially useful to the system with multi sampling rate mechanism, since retarding the timing of AD convertion is only required to change software and it requires no analog circuit before the AD converter.",

Among them, formant-bandwidth representation of AR model is said to be most advantageous to information rates. In this paper, we divided a pulse transfer function of AR model to a partial fraction form using Durand-Kerner method and residue formula. The obtained form is easily implemented by parallel connection of complex first order systems (CFOS). Additionally, we have programed the parameter identification algorithm for digital signal processor (DSP), and we have shown the computational efficiency for real-time processing.",

The mass of goods is a constant factor of this function. By the function and the maximum swing angle calculation formula, the mass value of goods can be calculated under the dynamic condition. The experimental results indicated that the measurement precision of more than 0.1% F.S. can be achieved.",

The reason seems to be that because the passage through resonance is a nonstationary resonance, FFT, which is Widely used in spectral analysis for stationary vibrations is not an appropriate method.

In this paper, we apply this method for passage through resonance of Duffing type oscillator which has multiple frequencies.
