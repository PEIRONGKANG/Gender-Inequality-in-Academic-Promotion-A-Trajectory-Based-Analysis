The bioplastics were ranked PHB &gt;&gt; PLA &gt; PCL in terms of anaerobic biodegradation rate. The biodegradability of PHB, PLA, and PCL was 90% in 9 days, 29% and 49% in 277 days, and 3% and 22% in 277 days, respectively. PBS could not be anaerobically biodegraded by the sludge used in this study. The eubacteria and archaea participating in anaerobic bioplastic biodegradation were detected using the RTPCR DGGE method. Some eubacteria participating in anaerobic biodegradation of PCL and PLA were of unique character. Eubacteria involved in anaerobic biodegradation of PHB were 98% homologous with Arcobacter thereius, Clostridium sp, and Clostridium sp, respectively. The eubacteria involved in the anaerobic biodegradation of PLA were 100% identical to Xanthomonadaceae bacterium and Mesorhizobium sp.; however, the other three bacterium were poorly related (&lt;95% similarity) to any of the cultured-bacterium or database sequences. Anaerobic biodegradation of PCL was conducted by eubacterium with 98% similarity to A thereius, and by five organisms with poor similarity (&lt;= 95%) to any of the cultured-bacterium or database sequences. Archaea involved in anaerobic biodegradation of PLA and PCL were 97% and 95% identical to Methanosaeta concilii and Methanobacterium petrolearium. Only faint bands were observed in the RT-PCR DGGE profile of the archaea generated during PHB anaerobic biodegradation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Organisms involved in anaerobic biodegradation of PHB were 97, 100, and 98% identical to Peptococcaceae bacterium Ri50, Bacteroides plebeius, and Catenibacterium mitsuokai, respectively. The organism involved in the anaerobic biodegradation of PCL, however, was poorly related (&lt\n95% similarity) to any of the cultured-bacterium database sequences. Anaerobic biodegradation of PLA was undertaken by an organism with 100% identity to Ureibacillus sp., and by three organisms with poor similarity (≤95%) to any database sequence. Bacillus infernus, Propionibacterium sp., and two unidentified species were implicated in the anaerobic biodegradation of all three biodegradable plastics. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The results showed that the tensile strength of PBS was improved (15%-78%) with the incorporation of CF (10-40 wt%) and was further increased (25%-118%) when CF was treated with a silane coupling agent. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of the fracture surfaces of PBS/CF composites showed that there was slight improvement in fiber-matrix compatibility. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis showed that the thermal stability of the composites was lower than that of neat PBS and decreased with increasing filler loading. The biobased carbon content of the composites increased with increasing CF content. The incorporation of CF (with and without silane treatment) in PBS significantly increased the biodegradation rate of the composites. © 2013 by the authors."

The anaerobic biodegradation rates of small pieces of PLA film were slower than for large pieces of PLA film. We also examined whether PLA film could also be used as a reference material in the anaerobic biodegradation test in addition to PLA powder. The anaerobic biodegradation rate of PLA film became slower with lower activity sludge, but the rate of decrease was gradual, and the anaerobic biodegradation rate of PLA film was faster than the PLA powder (125-250 mu m). The anaerobic biodegradation rate of the PLA powder (125-250 mu m) reflected the plastic anaerobic biodegradation activity of the sludge more accurately than the thin PLA film (thickness 25 mu m). Consequently, PLA powder (125-250 mu m) is more suitable than thin PLA film (thickness &lt; 25 mu m) for use as a reference material to assess the plastic anaerobic biodegradation activity of the sludge in an anaerobic biodegradation test at 55 A degrees C."

                        "en": "Here, we apply a method to evaluate the anaerobic biodegradability of bioplastics, such as polycaprolactone and poly(lactic acid) (PIA). in aquatic (slurry) conditions at 55 degrees C. Previous reports have suggested that some of the microorganisms participating in the anaerobic biodegradation of cellulose and PLA differ. However, polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis was ineffective at detecting the microorganisms involved in the anaerobic biodegradation of cellulose and PLA. In this study, reverse transcription-PCR-DGGE analysis was employed instead. New DGGE bands appeared during the anaerobic biodegradation of cellulose and PIA, and some of these DGGE bands differed between the anaerobic biodegradation of cellulose and PLA, indicating that some of the microorganisms involved in these two processes differed. These results and those of our previous study therefore show that it is necessary to describe, not the anaerobic biodegradation rate of cellulose, as generally used at present, but the anaerobic biodegradation rate of plastic in the plastic anaerobic biodegradation test, to evaluate the sludge condition containing plastic anaerobic biodegradation activity in the sludge used in the anaerobic biodegradation test of plastics at 55 degrees C.

For this method, we prepared the sludge at 55 degrees C from the sludge at 37 degrees C by the method in which the sludge from the real tank operating at around 37 degrees C using cow manure and vegetable waste as the feed stock was preincubated at 55 degrees C. It was unknown at which stage the sludge during preincubation has the optimized anaerobic biodegradation activity of plastics. Four different stage sludges during preincubation (the sludge at 7 days after the start of preincubation at 55 degrees C, at 12 days, at 18 days, and at 40 days) were compared by the anaerobic biodegradation activity of PLA. The preincubated sludge at around 18 days (a gradual decrease in biogas evolution and a methane ratio over 60%) showed the highest biodegradation activity of PLA. In addition, the bacterial population in each sludge was analyzed by the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments, however, the newly grown bacteria bands at 55 degrees C were not clearly detected.

With this system, the evolved biogas is collected in a gas sampling bag at atmospheric pressure. This method is more convenient than using a pressure transducer or inverted graduated cylinder submerged in water. The biodegradation of PCL powder (10 g, 125-250 mu m) in the diluted sludge stopped in about 47 days when the biodegradability reached 92%. The biodegradability of PLA powder (10 g, 125-250 mu m) in undiluted sludge was 91% at about 75 days. The biodegradability of PLA powder (10 g, 125-250 mu m) in diluted sludge was 79% at about 100 days. The biodegradability of PLA powder (5 g, 125-250 gm) in diluted sludge was 80% at about 85 days. It was found that the PCL and PLA powders were quite degraded using the new evaluation method. In addition, the smaller particle size PCL powder was biodegraded faster.

With this system, the evolved biogas is collected in a gas sampling bag at atmospheric pressure. This method is more convenient than using a pressure transducer or inverted graduated cylinder submerged in water. PLA was degraded about 60% in 30 days, about 80% in 40 days and about 90% in 60 days at 55 degrees C. On the other hand, the PLA degradation started in 55 days at 35 degrees C and degradation rate was much slower than at 55 degrees C."

                        "en": "Growth optimization of a docosahexaeneic acid (DHA) producing marine fungus, Thraustochytrium aureum (ATCC 34304), resulted in cell productivity of 5.7 g/l and 460 mg/l of total lipid in 69 h flask culture, almost twice the level of cell productivity obtained for the strain reported previously. The lipid extracted from the cells was primarily composed of triacylglycerol and contained about 40% DHA. The fermenter culture showed a lower growth rate than the flask culture indicating growth inhibition due to mechanical stirring. Cells grown in the fermenter showed a coagulant tendency. ATCC 34304, in culture, seems to reproduce asexually and the life cycle of the cells consists of a zoospore stage, trophic cell stage and sporangium stage. Zoospore release was observed once during the early growth phase throughout growth period both in flask and fermenter culture."

The production of odd-numbered fatty acids and methylene-heptadecanoic acid by <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp can be explained based on the intermediary propionyl-CoA from 1-propanol and propionicacid."

Further analysis of bacterium lipids revealed the additional production of N-acyl ornithine. The N-acyl ornithine had a 3-hydroxy fatty acid linked by an amide bond to α-amino group of ornithine and a nonhydroxy fatty acid esterified to the hydroxy group of the 3-hydroxy fatty acid. N-acyl ornithine was located in the cell membrane and N-acyl leucine and isoleucine in cytoplasm. N-acyl ornithine is thought to be a functional analogue of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) because of their similar structure. PE replacement into N-acyl ornithine in the cell membrane under phosphate-limited conditions was observed with other bacteria, so we anticipated the nonbiosynthesis of N-acyl ornithine under phosphate-sufficient conditions. We did not anticipate that N-acyl leucine and isoleucine in cytoplasm, whose structure is dissimilar to that of PE, would be replaced into PE in the cell membrane. Neither N-acyl leucine, N-acyl isoleucine, nor N-acyl ornithine was biosynthesized under phosphate-sufficient condition.
