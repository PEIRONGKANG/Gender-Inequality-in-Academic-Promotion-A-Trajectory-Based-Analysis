                        "en": "Background: Tissue blood flow (BF) is thought to be involved in the regulation of tissue blood oxygenation (StO(2)). The purpose of the present study was to show the relation between BF and StO(2) by measuring them simultaneously under different conditions.\nMethods: Twenty-one healthy subjects (age 21-30 years) participated in this study. We measured BF and StO(2) in a small area of skin (fingertip, palm, forearm) simultaneously using a laser Doppler flowmeter and a tissue oxygenation monitor. Three measurements were made at rest while performing mental arithmetic and during constriction of the ipsilateral upper arm.\nResults: At rest, BF and StO(2) were higher in the fingertip than in the palm or forearm (p &lt; 0.01). Performing mental arithmetic produced significant decreases in BF, oxygenated hemoglobin, and StO(2) in the fingertip (p &lt; 0.05). Constriction of the ipsilateral upper arm produced significant decreases in BF and StO(2) (p &lt; 0.05) and an increase in oxygenated hemoglobin (p &lt; 0.05). Both procedures produced significant increases in deoxygenated hemoglobin (p &lt; 0.05), which was in antiphase to the decrease in StO(2).\nConclusions: BF decrease produced a significantly decreased StO(2) in fingertip skin. The results show that simultaneous measurement of BF and StO(2) is beneficial for showing the close relation between them. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Although this decrease is considered to be due in part to slow blood flow, information regarding this velocity in humans has been lacking. The aims of the present study were to estimate the blood flow velocity in human dental pulp and to evaluate the validity of LDF modified for the measurement of slow blood flow.\nDesign: Mean blood flow velocities at the upper central incisor, gingiva, fingertip and forearm of 28 volunteers (mean age: 38.6 years old) were estimated using LDF with a frequency analyser. Blood flow signals at these measurement areas were recorded using two different LDFs: (a) one with a standard blood flow range; and (b) one modified for low blood flow velocity.\nResults: The frequency range of the Doppler shift measured at the teeth with an opaque rubber dam was the narrowest (median: 4.3 kHz) among all of the measurement areas. The estimated mean blood flow velocity was the slowest at the teeth with a dam (median: 0.18 mm/s). LDF for low blood flow velocity detected larger and clearer pulsatile blood flow signals from the teeth with dams than did standard LDF.\nConclusions: The present results indicate that the velocity of PBF in humans is very low and that LDF modified for the measurement of slow blood flow is appropriate for PBF measurement in humans.

The tooth suffered from acute apical periodontitis after periodontal treatment by a general practitioner. An access cavity was prepared in the tooth and the cavity was left open until the next visit to achieve drainage through the canal. The root canal was not mechanically cleaned during the treatment period, but was irrigated with hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite. Calcium hydroxide compound was used for disinfection. At the fifth visit vital tissue appeared in the canal near the apical region, and calcium hydroxide compound was placed in contact with the soft tissue in the root canal. The access cavity was sealed with glass-ionomer cement followed by an adhesive composite resin filling. Radiographic examination 30 months after the initial treatment confirmed closure of the apex and thickening of the root wall. The case was observed for up to 13 years and root development was confirmed."

In this study, the age-related changes in the hardness of the human gingival tissue were examined. The measurement was made on the young and the elder people who had clinically healthy gingival tissue using a tonometer. The labial surfaces of attached gingival site were selected as examination sites. The gingiva was significantly harder with elder subjects than the young subjects. The results indicated the age-related changes of gingival hardness."

Both light simultaneously illuminated the labial surface of the tooth crown and the transmitted-light through the tooth crown was collected from the palatal surface. The intensities of transmitted infrared light and the transmitted green light (TGL) were smaller when the lights were illuminated and collected from cervical area than incisal area. TGL with nonvital teeth was almost nil. The intensities of transmitted-light through tooth crown were considered to indicate the condition of the pulp and to be applicable to pulp diagnostic testing."

Recordings were taken from 22 clinically healthy upper central incisors in 22 healthy participants (age: 8-75 years). A Moor blood flow monitor (type MBF3D) was used to measure PBF\n and subjects' electrocardiogram (ECG), mean blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were also recorded. The resting PBF was significantly decreased with the increased age of the participants (Pearson's correlation coefficient, P &lt\n 0.001). The examined tooth crown was briefly (1s) cooled using a dental coolant, and significant reductions in PBF were induced (one-way repeated measures ANOVA, P &lt\n 0.05). The magnitude of the reduction (%) was significantly decreased with the increased age of the participants (Pearson's correlation coefficient, P &lt\n 0.05). The findings indicate that the hemodynamics in the human pulp is reduced with age."

                        "en": "Background: It is well known that severe gingival overgrowth (GO) is induced in patients taking certain calcium channel blockers (CCB) for the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, and other diseases. No case has been reported to date of severe GO induced by manidipine hydrochloride (manidipine), a second generation CCB. This case report describes severe GO induced by manidipine in a female patient (43 years old) with hypertension and Sjögren syndrome (SS). The patient was administered manidipine and carteolol hydrochloride (carteolol) as antihypertensive drugs, together with bromhexine hydrochloride for the treatment of SS. Methods: At the initial periodontal examination, probing depth (PD, average 4.83 mm), plaque control record (PCR, 84.3%), bleeding on probing (BOP, 100%), and gingival overgrowth index (GOI, 2.42) were assessed. The patient received periodontal treatment without cessation or replacement of the causative drug. Initial treatment included oral hygiene and scaling and root planing (SRP) under local anesthesia. As corrective therapy, remaining pockets were surgically removed and fixed bridges placed to establish proper occlusion. Results: Obvious reductions in PCR (10.0%), PD (1.93 mm), GOI (0.02), and BOP (4.7%), together with a disappearance of GO, were obtained. Salivary secretion was increased after the periodontal and prosthetic treatments. Histological features were similar to those of nifedipine-induced GO. Conclusions: This case indicated that manidipine may act as a potent inducer of severe GO, and that conventional periodontal treatments without a major change of the causative drugs can yield satisfactory clinical responses."

Instead of the standard root canal treatment protocol and apexification, antimicrobial agents were used in the canal, after which the canal was left empty. Radiographic examination showed the start of apical closure 5 months after the completion of the antimicrobial protocol. Thickening of the canal wall and complete apical closure was confirmed 30 months after the treatment, indicating the revascularization potential of a young permanent tooth pulp into a bacteria-free root canal space."

Laser Doppler flowmetric measurements were made from 17 vital upper left central incisors of 17 participants who had clinically healthy tooth crowns and periodontal tissues. Brief intrusive forces (0.5, 1, 5 N\n duration 20 s) were applied to the incisal edges of the examined teeth, and apical displacement of the teeth and the PBF were measured simultaneously. Recordings were made with and without an opaque rubber dam applied to the examined teeth. Intrusive force significantly reduced PBF flux both with and without the dam (P &lt\n 0.05, Friedman analysis). The results indicate that transient apical displacement can reduce PBF. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

Fifty-one frontal views of upper and lower incisors (male 14, female 13 ; upper 25, lower 26) were used. All of the pictures were taken using a digital camera with a stroboscope (Kodak DC 420 and Nikon Medical Nikkor 120 mm F 4). Theywere saved as Tag Image File Fonrlat (TIFF) files with 2^<24> color depth (Red 2^8, Green 2^8, Blue 2^8) using the Photo Shop 3 . O J^<[O!R]> (Image Processing Software ; Adobe Systems Inc., USA) . The size of each image was 1,524x 1,012 pixels, and 4.5 MB in memory size. We used IPLab Spectrum^<TM> (Image Processing Programing Software ; Signal Analytics Corporation, USA) for making the program. A histogram of each image was analyzed on RGB, HSV, YIQ and RSGSBS Color coordinate system. These histograms were in the range of [0,255]. The Gs-histogram peak near the 65-gray level was most valid of the 12 colors to separate the soft tissue and tooth areas. For automatic thresholding of vacant spaces, the correlation coefficient and the function between the modal values (MO) and the vacant thresholding values (VT) were calculated as follows using Red images : VT=0.527 x M0+ 16.05, r=0.763 (p<0.0001). Thresholding with calculated VT using MO mistakenly identified the low brightness areas of the soft tissue as vacant space. We plan to develop an algorithm for automatic recognition of the shape and redness ofthe interdental papilla. J. Jpn. Soc. Periodontol., 41 : 429-435, 1999."

                        "en": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the scatter of light through human teeth with laser Doppler flowmetry, An optical probe (probe 1), which mounted two optical fibers (one for light illumination and another for the measurement of backscattered light intensity) was placed on the labial surface of the extracted teeth. Another optical probe (probe 2) for the measurement of transmitted-light intensity was placed either on the mesial, distal, or palatal surface or in the canal of the teeth. The light intensity at probe 1 was stable, irrespective of the location of probe 2, whereas the transmitted light intensity at probe 2 tended to increase as probe 2 moved to more incisal positions on the mesial, distal, and palatal tooth surfaces, The results indicate that the light scatters to a wide area outside the tooth and provides information regarding the surrounding tissue blood flow."
