                        "en": "Seasonal variation in seabed elevation in the muddy intertidal zone of the Chao Phraya River delta, an area of serious coastal erosion for 40 years, was assessed using information on waves and tides predicted by numerical simulations. The study area is under the influence of the Southeast Asian monsoon climate and lies in the innermost part of a sheltered gulf, across which a low-gradient slope has developed. Observations, aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a prototype breakwater on mitigating coastal erosion, indicated that the seasonal variation in the seabed elevation, typically about 30 cm, was caused primarily by seasonal changes in wave direction and height. The breakwater seems to have contributed to a net rise in the seabed level at sites behind the structure. Seabed erosion was most apparent during the northeast monsoon, when waves are weak. Erosion under this low wave energy state was attributed to the combined effect of wave breaking and the low tidal level. A difference in the observed seabed accretion rate between the transitional intermonsoon period and the succeeding southwest monsoon period was attributed to the direction of the wave energy flux; offshore sediments seem to have been supplied efficiently to the study area by waves during the transitional period. Another potential cause of seabed erosion and accretion during the wet southwest monsoon season was the discharge of water and sediments from local canals associated with intense tropical rainfall; this discharge seems to be linked to land use in the coastal area. The results of this study show the importance of monitoring across-shore sediment transport for better understanding of coastal erosion processes. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

                        "en": "Due to changes in relative sea level of order 100 m, the contribution of tides and waves to net bed shear stress in shelf sea regions has varied considerably over the Late Glacial and Holocene. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of this ratio leads to a deeper understanding of the erosion and deposition of sediments over the shelf seas throughout this time period. Tidal and wave models are here applied to palaeo time slices of the northwest European shelf seas over the last 12,000 years. The model simulations include a series of sensitivity tests to account for the influence of interannual variability in wind conditions on the resulting bed shear stress. The results show that there has been a significant decrease over the last 12,000 years in shelf-scale mobilisation of coarse sediment. Since there was a lower magnitude of wave orbital velocity penetrating to the sea bed as a result of increasing relative sea level, this reduction in sediment mobilisation was primarily controlled by a shelf-scale decrease in wave-induced bed shear stress over the last 12,000 years. The predictions of mean and residual bed shear stress for the modelled palaeo time slices are a useful tool with which to inform site-selection and subsequent interpretation of sediment cores. In addition, the modelled reconstructions of palaeo tidal range over the shelf seas demonstrates the potential errors associated with assuming a present-day tidal range when correcting palaeo sea-level proxies from their deposited datum (e.g. palaeo mean high water spring tide) to palaeo mean sea level."

                        "en": "Using a global tidal model it is shown that the supply of tidal energy to the deep ocean was larger during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 18,000-22,000 years BP). The results were used to modify the rate of vertical mixing in a coupled ocean-atmosphere model set up for the present and LGM oceans. The increased levels of mechanical energy during the LGM were countered by a fresher upper North Atlantic, which led to a reduced circulation and deep water formation in spite of a trebling of the implicit mixing energy. This identifies the significance of accurately representing vertical mixing in climate models to estimate the recovery time-scales and timings of rapid catastrophic paleoceanographic events. From the estimated levels of implicit energy in the vertical mixing scheme an amendment to diffusivity based mixing schemes is suggested. Citation: Green, J. A. M., C. L. Green, G. R. Bigg, T. P.

                        "en": "The irregular seafloor of the narrow Irish Sea on the NW European Shelf has been documented over several decades. From recently collected swath bathymetry data, very large trochoidal. nearly symmetrical sediment waves are observed in many parts of the Irish Sea and appear similar to those described from other continental shelf seas in North America that were covered by glacigenic sediments during the Last Glacial Maximum. Swath multibeam and single beam bathymetry data, backscatter intensity, shallow seismic imagery, video footage and sediment cores from the Irish Sea high sediment waves have been integrated to identify their genesis with reference to present and past hydrodynamic variability. From cross-sectional profiles over asymmetrical sediment waves in the Irish Sea the direction of asymmetry is used to map residual bed stress directions and associated bedload transport paths. Irish Sea peak bed stress vectors were generated using a two-dimensional palaeo-tidal model for the NW European shelf seas and compare well with the observations. Tidally induced bed stresses are modelled to have increased between 7-10 ka BP, to be nearly symmetrical in magnitude and to have reversed in dominant direction on a millennial scale. These environmental conditions during the post-glacial marine transgression are suggested here to help comprehend the construction of the very large sediment waves, with local variations due to differences in sediment grain size, sediment supply, water depth and intensified currents due to seafloor slopes. Model parameterisation using an open ocean boundary with time-dependent tidal changes and the implementation of high-resolution bathymetric information will improve future models of small-scale bed shear stress patterns and improve the predictive value of such modelling efforts.

                        "en": "The linear tidal sand ridges (LTSR) of the Celtic Sea constitute the largest examples of their bedform type on Earth. Previous sedimentological and seismic stratigraphic interpretation suggests that the LTSR are moribund tidally remobilised sediments representing the transgressive systems tract. This interpretation is supported by two-dimensional finite-difference model reconstructions of the M-2 tide, forced using the output from a glacial isostatic adjustment model to derive palaeotopography, and a global ocean model to derive the tides on the ocean boundary, used here to reconstruct peak bed stress vectors for the Celtic Sea for timesteps covering the transgression since the Last Glacial Maximum (last 21 ka). These data are coupled with interpretation of recent published observations on the outer shelf depocentres of the Fleuve Manche and the Irish Sea Ice Stream (ISIS) to confirm that the LTSR distribution is consistent with modelled sand transport paths during transgression. The main phase of LTSR growth was between 20 cal ka and 12 cal ka. Ridge axis orientations reflect the final phase of LTSR construction around 12 cal ka, with some later growth of the most southerly LTSR as late as 10 cal ka. LTSR growth was from the SW across the shelf towards the NE. Strong tidal pumping of sediments into slope canyon heads on the outer shelf occurred between 20 cal ka and 12 cal ka, contributing to turbidite activity and the growth of the Celtic and Armorican deep sea fans. It is proposed that 1. the Fleuve Manche shelfal estuary-delta, and the Irish Sea Ice Stream (ISIS) shelf fan, were the main sediment depocentres supplying the growing LTSR, 2. the lack of sediments available in the western Channel limited LTSR growth in this area, and that the easterly termination of the LTSR in this sector results from sediment starvation, and 3. the northeasterly termination in the Celtic Sea sector is a function of declining peak bed stresses rather than sediment starvation. The Celtic Sea margin represents a passive margin depositional system transitional between true glacial ice stream-trough mouth fan systems (to the north) and the fluvial canyon systems characteristic of the margin to the south. This interpretation therefore complements studies of macroscale sedimentation linked to glaciation on the continental margins of the North Atlantic. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "Although shelf seas account for only 7% of the oceanic surface area, recent observations demonstrate that they host significant ocean-atmosphere CO2 fluxes. A mechanism implicated in driving a significant CO2 sink in the temperate shelf seas is the Continental Shelf Pump. Here we present an analysis of the impact of sea-level rise, and the consequent flooding of continental shelves, on the growth of the continental shelf CO2 pump over the last deglacial transition. We combine reconstructions of shelf palaeogeography, bathymetry and tides, with contemporary shelf sea-atmosphere CO2 flux estimates, to demonstrate the potential of the expanding shelf seas to have impacted on the global carbon cycle, via the continental shelf CO2 pump, over the past 21,000 years and, by inference, earlier glacial-interglacial cycles.

                        "en": "On the basis of bathymetric and seismic data and data from piston cores collected by the Chinese-French marine geology and geophysics investigation of 1996, we discuss the internal architecture and mobility of tidal sand ridges in the East China Sea (ECS). We characterized the sand ridges on the middle to outer shelf of the ECS as tide-dominated sand ridges with southwest dipping beds, indicating that the regional net sediment transport is toward the southwest. As the sand ridges gradually migrate toward the southwest, new sand ridges are continually replacing old ones, and several generations of sand ridges have developed in the study area.\nHigh-resolution seismic data, acoustic Doppler current profiler data, and two C-14-dated piston cores, DGKS9614 and DGKS9612-from a sand ridge swale and crest, respectively-show that these sand ridges, which are at water depths of 90-100 m, have been migrating for the last ca. 2-3 kyr at least, though these ridges have previously been interpreted as moribund or relict. Sequence stratigraphic interpretation of seismic profiles and core data show that tidal ridges in the ECS evolved from muddier sand ridges formed during the last transgression to sandier shelf sand ridges in response to the shoreline retreat, which resulted in a decrease of riverine muddy sediments and recycling of sandy materials by tidal currents. Most active sand ridge formation occurred during the last transgression, but the present sand ridges on the middle to outer shelf are still being influenced by the modern hydrodynamics. Therefore, these sand ridges on the ECS shelf should be referred to as \"quasi-active sand ridges\" rather than as moribund or relict sand ridges. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

                        "ja": "A new Semi-Lagrangian scheme using Rational Runge-Kutta method (RKSL scheme)is developed for reduced-gravity ocean model. It is superior to Semi-Implicit/Semi-Lagrangian (SISL) scheme in handling lateral boundaries, whereas it can take longer time-step than usual external Eulerian schemes. To evaluate this new scheme, experiments simulating the mid-depth circulation of the Mediterranean outflow region in the eastern North Atlantic were made by using the RKSL scheme, the SISL scheme, and centered-difference Eularian scheme. It is found that the calculation time for the two Semi-Lagrangian schemes were comparable with each other and more than five times longer compared with the Eularian scheme. More efficient method for searching the displacement of the particles is required to reduce the calculation time. The RKSL scheme seemed to be less sensitive to the precision of the interpolation scheme than the SISL scheme."

                        "en": "Steady abyssal circulation is investigated with a simple reduced-gravity model where horizontal diffusion of interfacial displacement is taken into account in addition to ordinary vertical diffusion of Newtonian cooling. The horizontal diffusion and viscosity tum out to change the structure of boundary layers and the field of vertical velocity both on f- and beta-planes. The dynamics of western boundary layers is classified into the viscous and diffusive regimes. In either regime, horizontal diffusion dominates the distribution of vertical velocity. Downwelling prevails in the western offshore boundary current flowing equatorward, while upwelling is always found in the poleward current. A more intense. opposite vertical motion occurs in a narrower boundary layer adjacent to the western coast. Downwelling is often distributed in a broad interior region, where horizontal diffusion again plays a crucial role in determining both horizontal and vertical velocities. The present model explains this downwelling in terms of the diffusion of the thickness term in potential vorticity. It is shown that only when the horizontal diffusion is incorporated is the reduced-gravity model capable of reproducing the complicated distribution of vertical velocity in the abyssal layer which has been repeatedly reported in various three-dimensional experiments. The present model is also applicable to the surface layer, extending the Sverdrup-Stommel-Munk theory of the homogeneous ocean to that more suitable for the stratified ocean."
