                        "en": "The formation of a vortex street is numerically studied as an aftermath of a transient (approximate to 1 min) depression of the energy density of injected particles. It is basically assumed that the kinetic energies of auroral particles are substantially provided by nonadiabatic acceleration in the tail current sheet. One of the causes of such energy density depression is an outward (away from the Earth) movement of the neutral line because in such situation, a particle passes the acceleration zone for a shorter time interval while it is inwardly transported in the current sheet. The numerical simulation shows that a long chain of many (&gt;= 5) vortices can be formed in the nighttime high-latitude auroral oval as a result of the hybrid Kelvin-Helmholtz/Rayleigh-Taylor (KH/RT) instability. The main characteristics of long vortex chains in the simulation such as the short lifetime (less than or similar to 2 min) and the correlation between wavelength, lambda, and arc system width, A, compare well with those of the periodic auroral distortions observed primarily in the high-latitude auroral oval. Specifically, either lambda-A relationship from simulation or observation shows a positive correlation between lambda and A but with considerable dispersion in lambda. Since auroral vortices arising from the hybrid KH/RT instability are not accompanied by significant rotational motions, the magnetic shear instability caused by undulations in the field-aligned current (FAC) sheet could turn the vortices into spirals which wind or unwind in response to increase or decrease of FACs, respectively."

                        "en": "The formation of the omega bands and torch structures in the recovery phase of a substorm is numerically simulated. The kinetic energies of auroral particles are substantially provided by nonadiabatic acceleration in the tail current sheet. The magnetic drift flux (in the adiabatic sense) of the plasma sheet ions increases with decreasing invariant latitude; it starts to increase significantly around a certain magnetic shell, which is assumed, as a first approximation, to be the interface demarcating the nonadiabatic and adiabatic regions in the tail current sheet. Region 1 field-aligned currents can be generated in the situation that this interface is inclined with respect to the direction of the average magnetic drift velocity. As long as the energy density of injected particles does not significantly change with time, the region 1 current remains stable and no electrostatic waves with long wavelengths (&gt; 100 km at the ionospheric height) grow. Since the nonadiabatic particle acceleration is assumed to weaken during the (early) recovery phase of a substorm, the flux-tube-integrated energy density of injected particles attains a latitudinal profile unstable to the hybrid Kelvin-Helmholtz/Rayleigh-Taylor instability. While injected particles with less kinetic energies are transported to magnetic shells at lower latitudes, the unstable region expands in latitude so that long-wavelength waves develop in the plasma sheet. Then omega bands similar to those observed commonly in the substorm recovery phase form. The main characteristics of the omega bands in the simulation are shown to be consistent with observations."

                        "en": "This paper is to generalize the previous linear analysis of the hybrid Kelvin-Helmholtz/Rayleigh-Taylor (KH/RT) instability in a system of the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling, which is valid in the long-wavelength limit of Lk(y) &lt;&lt; 2, where k(y) is the azimuthal wave number and L stands for the scale length of a latitudinal profile in azimuthal velocity or energy density. For the first time, the linear growth rate profile of a hybrid wave can be revealed in an essentially overall range of k(y). When the gradient of the energy density is directed inward (toward inner magnetic shells), the hybrid growth rate is positive (meaning growth) in a certain range of k(y): 0 &lt; Lk(y) &lt; (k) over tilde (m)(y). As the inertial relaxation rate v approaches zero, the growth rate curve is close to the KH \"spectrum&apos;&apos; with (k) over tilde (m)(y) = 2, where Sigma(P)/C(m), the ratio between the inertial capacitance of the magnetospheric plasma and the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity in the ionosphere. Without a velocity shear in the background flow, the spectrum much broadens, namely, the RT spectrum appears. The hybrid growth rate is shown to have a spectrum intermediate between the two ones of the corresponding KH and RT \"root&apos;&apos; instabilities. It is also found that the electrostatic KH instability is completely suppressed when the KH growth rate, estimated excluding the M-I coupling, is less than v, which is a straightforward extension of that previous work. On the basis of the evaluation of Cm in the Tsyganenko model, electrostatic waves (with wavelengths greater than a few tens of kilometers at the ionospheric height) are unlikely to grow by the KH instability alone in the nighttime plasma sheet. Instead, hybrid waves can grow at the places where the particle energy density has an inward gradient. This fact may account for the frequent appearance of periodic auroral luminosity in a high-latitude part of the nighttime oval as well as the formation of omega bands typically in the recovery phase of a substorm."

                        "en": "[1] A linear analysis of the hybrid Kelvin-Helmholtz/Rayleigh-Taylor (KH/RT) instability in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system is presented. In the magnetosphere plasma particles can move by the electric (E X B) drift, magnetic drift (gradient B drift plus curvature drift), and inertia drift. Field- aligned currents are generated primarily from divergence of the magnetic drift flux. They are closed via Pedersen currents in the ionosphere. As a simple model, there is a surface of discontinuity both in the azimuthal flow and the particle energy density, which extends longitudinally as projected to the ionospheric plane. The gradient of the energy density is directed inward or outward so that the plasma is RT unstable or stable, respectively. The present analysis shows that only a velocity shear cannot drive the system KH unstable when the growth rate, gamma(KH), of the KH instability without Pedersen coupling is less than the inertial relaxation rate, nu, and that the presence of an energy density gradient allows a hybrid wave to grow even when gamma(KH) &lt; nu. The wave growth is due to the active charge separation driving originally the RT instability. The picture of auroral deformations now changes drastically. The traditional picture is such that if the Pedersen coupling is properly taken into account, KH waves of long wavelengths (greater than or similar to 100 km at the ionospheric height) are found evanescent in the main body of the auroral oval. A new one is such that wavy structures therein can develop, only in the KH/RT hybrid mode, at the places where the particle energy density has an inward gradient. Similarly, the stability of the inner boundary of the low-latitude boundary layer is controlled by the RT stability conditions more influentially than the KH conditions."

                        "en": "We reassess the mathematical expression for statistical distributions of latitudinal extents of electron acceleration events; the distributions have been obtained by Newell et al. ( 1996, hereinafter referred to as N96) using precipitation data from all Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellites. Paper N96 proposed a basic hypothesis that within a ( given) large-scale region of upward field-aligned currents (FACs), any 1-s spectrum has a constant probability, P, of experiencing electron acceleration independently of neighboring spectra. Directly from this hypothesis, the probability of observing n consecutive accelerated spectra, denoted by Q(n), is newly derived as the correction of \"Pn-1(1 - P)'' that was assumed in N96. Necessarily, Q(n) is a function of the probability P and the latitudinal width W of a large-scale FAC region; hence it is written as Qn( W, P). The occurrence frequency distribution ( histogram) of latitudinal extents of observed acceleration events can be identified with a statistical superposition of a number of Qn( W, P) in relatively wide ranges of W and P. For fitting to the histograms obtained in N96, 0.1 degrees W and 0.7 P 0.98 are appropriate. This prediction is quite in contrast with N96's supposition that P is nearly constant and that normally the width of a large-scale FAC region is sufficiently large to accommodate many accelerated spectra. ( The appearance of region 1 FACs of narrow widths has already been identified both observationally and theoretically.)."

                        "en": "A time-independent model of the dayside auroras is presented within the framework of the pressure-gradient-driven mechanism for the generation of the region 1 field-aligned current (FAC) in the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL). Either of two types of the dayside aurora, the bright spots (BSs) or the radially aligned arcs (RAs), arises from spatial modulation of the inner boundary of an LLBL particle population, but the respective source populations have different contents. BSs are produced when the boundary of a majority of the LLBL particle population is modulated. RAs are produced by large-amplitude modulation occurring on a sharp boundary of a small fraction of the LLBL particle population. The required flux tube content, delta N, of the source population of RAs is roughly 10% of that of the ambient population, if the scale length for del delta N at the inner boundary is comparable to the magnetopause thickness. Using the 1989 Tsyganenko model, the FAC densities from the perturbed inner boundary of the particle population are evaluated and the energy fluxes of electrons precipitating to the ionosphere are then calculated on the basis of the Knight current-voltage relation. This model can demonstrate the characteristic patterns of the RAs as well as the BSs. It also predicts that (1) both types of aurora with high luminosity as well as inverted-V structures appear more frequently in the afternoon than in the morning, (2) this morning-afternoon asymmetry is more pronounced for the case of BSs than RAs, and (3) during periods of northward interplanetary magnetic field, RAs can be distributed over a large area of the polar cap. Now the MLT-dependent features of the dayside auroras, the appearances of \"hot spot'' and \"warm spot,'' and the large-scale region 1 FAC generation can be understood systematically in view of the distortion of the (average) inner boundary of an LLBL particle population (i.e., nonalignment of the boundary with the average magnetic drift direction)."

                        "en": "[1] A numerical simulation is performed to identify the physical mechanisms for the generation of the nighttime region 0 and region 1 field-aligned currents (FACs) in conditions of a steady solar wind with a southward or weak interplanetary magnetic field. The generation of region 0/region 1 FACs observed near the poleward edge of the auroral oval is closely associated with the dynamics of ion beams produced by nonadiabatic acceleration in the tail current sheet. After ejection from the current sheet, ion beams advance toward the Earth along the nearly straight field lines. During such a time interval, the ions have insignificant magnetic drift velocities. Subsequently, they are reflected at low-altitude mirror points, and under the influence of inward convection they pass the equator on magnetic shells that are further in. At that moment they attain large magnetic ( curvature) drift velocities. Accordingly, in a steady state, the magnetic drift speed averaged over all the ions in a flux tube increases with decreasing invariant latitude; it starts to increase significantly at a certain magnetic shell. In the present paper this magnetic shell is identified with the interface demarcating the nonadiabatic and adiabatic regions in the tail current sheet. An essential point for the region 1 FAC generation is distortion of this interface, namely inclination of the interface to the direction of the average magnetic drift velocity. The generation of region 0 FACs is due to anomalous cross-field diffusion of energized ions near the poleward edge of the auroral oval. Latitudinal profiles of magnetic field perturbations arising from region 0/region 1 FACs in the simulation are remarkably similar to observed magnetic field signatures of the region 0/region 1 thin-current-sheet systems."

This paper, however, shows that at least for daytime ( 0800 - 1600 MLT) FACs, the current generator has the same characteristic of \"linear relationship between the current intensity and the conductivity'' as the voltage generator. This conclusion is obtained due to the fact that the sum of Pedersen conductivities, maintained by solar EUV ionization, at two conjugate points on the northern and southern ionospheres is approximately independent of the solar zenith angle at either of these points. Notably, the pressure-gradient-driven model for the generation of the region 1 FAC from the low-latitude boundary layer is then consistent with observations that the current intensity increases linearly with the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity."

This FAC generation arises from the divergence of the magnetic drift current density carried by LLBL particles, and the current intensity is then increased with their kinetic energy density. The FAC generation occurs at the inner edge of the LLBL whenever sheath particles penetrate into the magnetosphere, regardless of the entry process. It is also emphasized that the LLBL FAC production is an inevitable consequence of the formation of the magnetopause, because the magnetopause currents act to shield the magnetic field originating from the currents inside the closed region of the magnetosphere, causing the LLBL inner edge to intersect the magnetic drift paths.

                        "en": "This paper calls attention to the limitation of the current sheet approximation, which has commonly been used in deducing the field-aligned currents (FACs) from the field-perpendicular components of magnetic field disturbances detected from low-altitude/midaltitude: (below a few Earth radii) satellites. We focus our study on the current system involved in the northward interplanetary magnetic field associated FAC (so-called northward B-Z (NBZ)). Assuming a numerical model for the total system of the region 1, region 2, and NBZ FACs, plus the associated ionospheric currents, the dusk-to-dawn and sunward components of the resulting magnetic disturbance delta B-x and delta B-y are calculated. In contrast to the commonly adopted hypothesis that the field-perpendicular magnetic disturbances as observed from the low-altitude (a few hundred kilometers) satellites are attributed primarily to the FACs, it is found that the ionospheric currents can make a significant contribution to those disturbances. Particularly, in the central part of the region of NBZ FACs, delta B-x from the ionospheric currents dominates delta B-x from the FACs. Next, for a simple discussion on the limit of the current sheet approximation we consider the magnetic disturbances at altitudes higher than several hundred kilometers where the contribution (to delta B-y) from the ionospheric currents can be neglected. It is found that in general, the FAC intensities based on the current sheet model are significantly different from those actually given in the FAC distribution. Specific points to be noted are as follows: (1) On the dusk-dawn lines passing the central part of the NBZ region the intensity of NBZ under the current sheet approximation is considerably smaller than the actual value, and the intensity ratio between region 1 and NBZ can be overestimated, by &gt;50%, under that approximation. (2) On the dusk-dawn lines near the edges (but just inside) of the NBZ region, the current sheet model breaks down even qualitatively; the current sheet model cannot infer the right locations of region 1 and NBZ FACs. (3) On the dusk-dawn lines just outside of the NBZ region the so-called \"W''-shaped profile in delta B-y, which can commonly be interpreted as a signature of the presence of NBZ FACs, emerges in the region where actually no NBZ FAC exists."

                        "ja": "Using the Tsyganenko magnetic field model (TSYGANENKO, Planet. Space Sci., 37, 5, 1989) we make an attempt to determine the outer boundary of the closed region when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is southward. As a simple magnetic field model including the effect of IMF B_z<0, the B_z component of a constant value of minus a few nanoTeslas is added to the magnetic field in the Tsyganenko model with low K_p values. In this paper, if the magnetic field strength, B, is not less than 2 nT in the whole range of a field line (namely the minimum B along a field line is greater than 2 nT), this field line is judged to be \"firmly\" closed. The firmly closed field lines are thought to be definitely closed as long as the fluctuation amplitude of B_z (around its average level) in the interplanetary (solar wind) magnetic field is less than 2 nT. The outer boundary of the firmly closed region is then constituted by field lines with the minimum B of 2 nT. This boundary is found to be close to (just inside of) the open-closed boundary, which can be determined with accuracy of 0.01° in latitude of the foot point of a field line. It is found that a circle with the center at a latitude of about 85° on the midnight meridian can be fitted to the outer boundary of the firmly closed region, as it is projected to the ionosphere. Interestingly this circle coincides with a typical auroral circle; the auroral circles are those delineating the poleward boundary of the quiet auroral belt, which were earlier identified from the statistical analysis of satellites' auroral images by MENG et al. (J. Geophys. Res., 82, 164, 1977). Importantly we find that the outer boundary of the firmly closed region is \"distorted\" on the nightside in the sense that the ionospheric projection of the average magnetic drift velocity of a plasma with isotropic pressure is not parallel to the boundary; more specifically, that of an isotropic ion fluid has an equatorward component on the duskside boundary and a poleward one on the dawnside boundary, respectively. This kind of the boundary distortion may be one of the possible causes of the generation of the nightside region 1 field-aligned current, which has been first suggested by HRUSKA (J. Geophys. Res., 91, 371, 1986) and recently, further studied by YAMAMOTO and INOUE (Proc. NIPR Symp. Upper Atmos. Phys., 11, 106, 1998)."

                        "en": "As an extension of the model for generation of a pair of region 1 and region 2 field-aligned currents (FACs), which has been proposed by Yamamoto and Ozaki [1993], we study the formation of auroral omega bands in the region 1-region 2 FAC system. In their model the hot plasma torus (HPT) is defined as the hot (greater than or similar to keV) plasma population contained in the magnetic shell which is connected to two ovals of diffuse auroras on the northern and southern polar ionospheres. Their numerical simulation has shown that the paired region 1-region 2 FACs can be generated as a result of the distortion of the HPT in the magnetosphere, which occurs under the influence of the solar wind convection. That HPT system is potentially unstable: Under certain conditions the electrostatic interchange instability due to the particle magnetic drifts can be fully developed on the poleward side of the HPT. The two-dimensional particle simulation in the present paper demonstrates that an azimuthal chain of electric dipoles is formed by the interchange instability developing in the paired region 1-region 2 FAC system. This means a drastic modification of the original region 1 and region 2 FACs such that a sequence of east-west oriented pairs of downward and upward field-aligned currents emerges in the region 1 zone. The pattern of upward FACs thus formed, with tongues extending poleward, can be identified with the omega bands or torch structures. The magnetospheric (or ionospheric) potential distribution obtained in the simulation is consistent with the observed distributions of ionospheric electric field and field-aligned currents in events of torches/omega bands."

                        "en": "Convective generation of ''giant'' undulations on the equatorward boundary of an evening diffuse aurora is numerically simulated. A giant undulation is defined as a waveform having the crest-to-trough amplitude comparable to the wavelength. The two-dimensional electrostatic particle code is used for studying the motion of magnetospheric plasma perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. According to the simulation results by Yamamoto et al. [1993], the giant undulation is a manifestation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) waves arising from the polarization of ''an arc sheet'' (dense plasma population of ionospheric origin) in the magnetosphere, which is assumed to be located just equatorward of the region of proton diffuse aurora. In this previous simulation, initially, irregularities are given evenly over the entire azimuthal length of the arc sheet so that the resulting undulations are periodic. The present simulation deals with a different situation, that a K-H wave starts growing from local irregularities on the polarized arc sheet. The simulation results show that the disturbance propagates both westward and eastward (relative to the background flow), forming a series of K-H waves along the arc sheet. As a consequence, giant undulations with spatially varying amplitudes are developed on the equatorward boundary of a diffuse aurora, which is located just poleward of the arc sheet. A series of giant undulations convectively produced in the simulation is remarkably similar to some auroral images photographed from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. In addition, we show the direct evidence for the presence of an arc sheet, probably associated with the giant undulations, which is provided by the measurements of precipitating particles from the DMSP F7 satellite crossing the equatorward boundary of the diffuse aurora; the high-density (approximately 10 cm-3) ions with energy of a few hundred electron volts are detected near the edge of the region of energetic (approximately 10 keV) ion precipitation. The primary cause of the formation of that arc sheet is thought to be escape of the oxygen and hydrogen ions from the topside ionosphere, due to the transverse acceleration by the ion-cyclotron waves."

                        "en": "By numerical simulations, it is shown that the evolution of a westward-traveling surge can be identified with the aurora deformation due to the appearance of a westward plasma flow at the boundary between the open and closed field lines. It is assumed that the westward flow is generated from nonadiabatic proton acceleration in the region of magnetic field reconnection by enhancement of the westward inductive electric field. The numerical simulation is performed by using the two-dimensional electrostatic particle code, which is capable of studying plasma dynamics in a plane perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. The present model for the westward-traveling surge assumes the following background state ((1) and (2)) in the plasma sheet boundary layer magnetically connected to the high-latitude auroral ionosphere. (1) A well potential (DELTAphi &lt; -10 kV) is distributed uniformly in the azimuthal direction, being responsible for a large-scale inverted-V structure. (2) A number of azimuthally aligned sheets of dense plasmas (which are called arc sheets) exist in the large-scale potential well. The electrons in such arc sheets can be accelerated by field-aligned electric fields distributed at low altitudes, and they can thus produce a number of discrete arcs longitudinally elongating at the ionospheric altitude. Initially, a westward plasma flow appears (near local midnight) at the last closed magnetic shell, inside which a number of the arc sheets are located. The temporal and spatial evolution of the discrete arcs are numerically followed in a plane perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. The simulation results show that some discrete arcs can convolute in a few minutes and form the surge structure. The surge head is found to typically move westward with a speed of approximately 1 km/s. Convolution of discrete arcs is due to local accumulation of positive space charges carried by the accelerated protons. Such positive charge accumulation in the magnetosphere is not strong so that the auroral electrons can still be accelerated toward the ionosphere by the field-aligned potential drop resulting from the potential well. Both effects of the diminished field-aligned potential drop and electron acceleration in the reconnection region may lead to production of the flat and hard differential energy spectrum of precipitating electrons observed inside a surge. A remarkable similarity in dynamics between the numerically simulated surges and the observed ones strongly suggests that the westward-traveling surge is driven by a local westward plasma flow at the boundary between the open and closed field lines. (Recently, the high-altitude (approximately 10,000 km) observations from the EXOS-D satellite (T. Yamamoto et al., manuscript in preparation, 1993) have first revealed the existence of a plasma jet just poleward of a surge.) An expanding auroral bulge can also be reproduced by assuming wider (in latitude) spreading of the particles accelerated in the reconnection process."

                        "en": "The mechanism for omega bands and torch structures as observed on the poleward boundary of the postmidnight diffuse aurora is studied by a two-dimensional electrostatic particle simulation for the motion of magnetospheric plasma perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. This type of diffuse aurora is caused by precipitation of energetic electrons with energies in excess of a few keV. In the model, the diffuse aurora (which may be identified with the central plasmasheet) is embedded within a less energetic but hot plasma which extends to higher latitudes. The temporal evolution of the diffuse auroral pattern can be visualized by following the cluster of the energetic electrons. Electric dipoles can grow on the poleward boundary of the hot plasma, due to charge separation induced by magnetic drifts. As a result of these dipoles, there is a spatial modulation of the energetic electrons, which leads to the formation of omega bands and the subsequent evolution into torch structures. The magnetospheric (or ionospheric) potential distribution obtained in the simulation is consistent with observed distribution of ionospheric electric fields and field-aligned currents in events of torches/omega bands."
