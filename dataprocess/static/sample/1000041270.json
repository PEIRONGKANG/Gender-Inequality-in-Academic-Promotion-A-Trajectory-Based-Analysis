                        "en": "© 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. This chapter discusses the increased influence of political leadership over education policies during the past decades in Japan by providing a detailed assessment of recent teacher education reforms from periods not covered in previous studies. For this purpose, it will first describe how education policy-making has changed over the past few decades (including critical changes such as power shifting after reorganizations of government ministries), then provide a brief history of teacher education reforms in Japan, and finally scrutinize the contents of the recent reform proposed by the Central Council on Education Report 184. In addition, the chapter will explain stronger national control over teacher education and standardization of teacher education at universities across the country, with examples of the devaluation of academic knowledge in teacher education. Then, it will describe the absence of opposition to the radical policy changes by describing detailed conditions that seemingly inhibit universities and teachers’ unions from becoming influential over the direction of the reforms. The chapter will conclude with discussions on how and why the reforms will be less likely to achieve the professionalization of teachers, which is the goal of reform efforts in other societies."

First, I summarize the present situation of teacher training in terms of the fostering of jissenteki-sidouryoku, and second, I outline the anticipated results of this reform. Finally, I indicate how, under this situation, we should conceptualize an image of researchers responsible for training students who hope to be teachers. Although it is not completely clear what the term jissenteki-sidouryoku means in practice, reform of teacher education with this goal in mind is nevertheless proceeding in two directions. (1) The first direction is to help students gain self-discipline and experience in school settings, which means providing them with ample opportunities to function as interns, aides, or student teachers during their education. Achieving this goal will also involve strengthening linkages between universities, educational committees, and schools. (2) In addition, however, new standards or criteria that properly assess students' skills and knowledge in the classroom in terms of jissenteki-sidouryoku are being developed for student teachers, beginning teachers, and so on, by various concerned institutions. However, both these directions of teacher education reform many encounter serious problems. (1) Although students certainly learn many roles from their experiences in different school settings and job roles, such a program only lets them adapt to the current state of school culture. As a result, these activities strengthen the traditional school culture more and more, when the ultimate goal is to change it to reflect a changing society and the changing needs of students. (2) It is unlikely that teaching standards will ever be able to adequately reflect the specific situation of each school, since to apply across institutions, they must first reflect the common conditions among schools. Moreover, often when such standards are implemented, inexperienced teachers will view them not merely as an index of teaching effectiveness but as the purpose of their daily activities, a rule to be adhered to. Thus, effective educational reform focused on fostering jissenteki-sidouryoku for teachers operating in a changing society is not yet available. In the latter part of this paper, I will consider the following two. First, we, as researchers, must bring ourselves to understand what we mean by jissenteki-sidouryoku, and in that sense, we have to clarify teachers' process of professional development. Research findings from adjacent fields, for example cognitive psychology, business administration, and so on, are available for the consideration of this issue. Second, we have to consider the background of the use of the term jissenteki-sidouryoku. Probably, the idea that jissenteki-sidouryoku is a useful key term for the professional development of teachers is misleading. What teachers really need is knowledge about postmodern society and the changing conditions outside of schools. Universities responsible for teacher education should offer courses in theory or knowledge of relations between schools and society."

                        "en": "In recent years, temporary layoffs leaves of absence by of teachers owing to illness have been on the rise in our country Japan. While many previous studies have attempted to explain this phenomenon, few have provided achieved concrete results. In this paper, I point out that this is because teachers have hitherto not been viewed as government employees. Thus, this paper studies the above phenomenon by while considering teaching as a form of educational labor. A brief description of the four main features of this paper is provided below: 1) I examine the teacher-client relationship as a clue to for understanding the concept of caring. This concept refers to considering someone as important and attending to his/or her needs. Nurturing is an activity that was traditionally performed in various communities and was interpreted in the same way as caring for family members. Today, relationships that involve nurturing activities can still be observed between teachers and students, to the extent that they have become an integral part of occupations in modern times. This is the reason that emotions and feelings are regarded as important in educational relationships and discussions. 2) I show that the concept of emotional labor is useful in studying the teaching profession. This concept focuses mainly on the emotional relationship between an emotional workers and theira clients. However, more importantly, it shows that in the modern service sector, an the employer exploits employees not only through physical labor but also through emotional labor, and the teaching profession is not an exception. 3) The Japanese government has promoted carried out educational reforms guided by neoliberal and quasimarket ideas as a part of public employee reforms. Through these reforms, the government has strengthens strengthened its control as an employer over the teaching sector. It urges thehas urged prefectural boards of education to make efforts to establish a new teacher evaluation systems and to improve the existing teacher appointment systems. Teachers are expected to work as members of a bureaucratic organization rather than a professional organization. 4) Furthermore, the teaching profession faces a big major problem: there is no group or organization that can protest against the exploitation of teachers, as can be seen from the failure of the teachers' unions. Thus, this paper argues that both teachers and researchers in this field should need to realize open their eyes to the actual situation wherein teachers work as public employees. Further, researchers in the field of educational sociology researchers should make theoretical contributions so that teachers are can gain the abilityable to understand their working conditions."

The two areas are: 1) who is the teacher educator, and 2) what is the philosophy of integrating the teacher education curriculum. The following points were clarified from overseas survey and data collected.１）teacher educators are expected to play a role of promoting 'reflection' about the practice of student teachers and teachers . They are engaged in student teachers' coaches, professorial research, curriculum development. However their identity as teacher educator differ each country. 2) In the EU countries, <Social justice> is required as a basis for curriculum construction against economic globalism"

It can be seen that this trend is gradually increasing with reference to past survey.

Recent educational reforms have meant that the schools will change in two directions. The first direction is vertical, that is, by becoming a more bureaucratic organization. The other direction is horizontal, that is, by having a greater variety of members in the school. Various experts such as SC and school social workers would be available in the school.The questionnaire survey that I carried out for teachers reveals the following findings. First, creating a new post, such as Shukan, does not help ameliorate teachers' ordinary activities but results in an increase in meetings. Second, having part-time teachers, SSW, and various other types of support would help reduce the workload of teachers. Third, it is difficult to change the school system to make it suitable for bureaucratic purposes, because the sphere of teachers' daily activities is not defined clearly"

The new educational policy such as teacher evaluation, professional graduate school,' super teacher' and a teacher certification renewal system carried out in JAPAN.How do teachers perceive this current? It is important to consider teachers' grasp and reaction against this educational reform. And to investigate teachers' recognition about the educational reform provide us the data to think about a model of the future teaching profession. In addition, to make a discussion based on the data is enable to the international comparative study as for a teaching profession.I conducted a survey of teachers' perception about the educational reform, especially the change of their work conditions, focusing on the public school teachers. As a result, I got the more over 1000 teachers' data.The findings getting by this survey are as follow:(1) teachers in Japan agree with the educational reform. Most of them are getting reflective about their practice by teacher evaluation system. Most of them require the supporting by another kinds of profession like a counselor and the volunteers, as so far as their hegemonies in their classroom are not disturb.(2) Teachers, who agree with the educational reform, work harder than others. Therefore they are exhausted by hard work.(3) These results different from the conditions in the U. K. reported by S.

Because of the holistic features, however, Japanese teachers take on too much responsibilities for children and they are exhausted by now.The aim of this research is to consider the possibilities of Japanese typed school ---How should we improve and support public schools in Japan?By the way, some research works show more and more teachers in the United State or Britain,in the same way in Japan,get to deal with a wide spectrum of activities including academic lessons, moral education, home visitation and so on, because more and more children get to have problems that stem from their family back ground.Consequently it is important to investigate what kind of people(professions, specialist, aids) take the part of these activities in school and how can we support teachers' work out of school.In this research, I focused on the activities of Restorative Justice, especially victim offender mediation program in the United State. When teachers suffer from dealing with vandalism, school violence, bulling and so on, restorative Justice has been paid attention as a dynamic and innovative way dealing with these conflict in schools. Because it can improve the quality of school life not only through conflict resolution, but also in terms of developing active citizenship skills.In the United State, VOMA(Victim Offender Mediation Association, in Minneapolis, take the role of international center to extend its philosophy and to provide the information to people and agency that are interested in RJ. And SMC(School Mediation Center) in Colorado, one of non profitable organizations registered, on VOMA, offer the information and much kind of program to help school improvement.These cases show :(1)In recent years, school in the United State get to have a lot of activities on its hands, because children's back ground get to be diversity.(2)schools need the support out of schools to resolve a lot of problems. and,(3)many kinds of voluntary organization like VOMA,SMC etc. get to support schools.When we reflect these cases, we can point out the following matters are important in Japan : the agency for supporting school has to be organized. Or the organizations concerning with bringing up children like department of welfare, correction and so on, has to be reorganized for supporting school. Moreover we need the staffs, who can produce the network of organizations that take responsibility for bringing up children"

Comparative and sociological research on recent educational reforms and policies in the countries like Japan, UK and USA : In many developed countries including Japan, UK and USA, radical education reforms have taken place for the purposes of educational quality enhancement, excellence seeking, administrative efficiency and transparency in education, and so forth. Some dangers are involved in these reform movements, such as the danger of restructuring education by \"the logic of the strength\" that is tied up with neo-liberal and market-oriented ideologies ; the dangers of neglecting the comprehensiveness, collaborative nature and professional expertise of teachers and teaching and of the trivialization of teacher's role ; the danger of newly emerging management and control style by testing and audit culture ; and the danger of undermining and deteriorating the trust toward and confidence of teachers and the legitimacy of teacher roles.2. Analysis of the questionnaire survey on teachers' life and work conducted in Japan, China and UK : Survey items cover teacher's daily life ; teacher-student relationship ; collegial relations among teachers ; teachers' views of students, education and teaching profession ; parents' expectations to schools and teachers ; activities and their composition of teachers' work ; school management ; teaching practices and efforts to develop teaching capacity ; and so forth. The following aspects and themes are investigated, such as the structure of teacher's work and autonomy ; forms, conditions and culture of collegiality, collaboration, cooperation and community of teachers ; the structure of professional expertise and confidence of teachers ; changes of educational environments and their associated intensification of teaching job ; and modes of teaching practices and teachers' habitus. It revealed that the level of collegiality and collaboration is higher among Japanese teachers than among Chinese or British teachers and that its level and modes are linked with and embedded in institutional and organizational arrangements of Japanese schools and educational apparatuses.3. International Conference on Teaching and Teacher Education in the 21^<st> Century was hosted at International Christian University in December 2003. Major findings of the above-mentioned two researches were presented at various conferences held both inside and outside Japan, and published as articles for academic journals, as book chapters and as two research reports"

Based on ethnografic research conducted at three junior high school, I found the following :(1) Personal information play an important part in teacher-student relationship.(2) Students get to respect and obey their teachers from information, because personal information about teachers is the criterion whether teachers can be relied on or not. On the other hand(3) Teachers can know them more and can recognize their behavior and motivation.Although they expect the personal relationship each other, they do not have much time to interact.Secondly I investigate the block factor for which they can't interact satisfactory.(4) Managing time and behavior in the school deprive them of meaning of school life.Based on this research, it is necessary that the teacher isn't only the person that teach the academic curriculla but also the model, the counselleror and so on"

For this purpose, we conducted three major studies : (1) The questionnaire survey on roles, daily practices and life style of 1177 elementary and lower secondary school teachers in Japan and 728 teachers in China ; (2) Study on education reform movements and their influences over teachers' roles and daily practices in about 10 countires including Japan, UK, USA, Switzerland, Shingapore, Germany and China ; and (3) The questionnaire survey on school events and special acitivities at elementary and lower secondary schools in Tokyo and in Japan. Some of the research results were published as academic journal papers as well as presented at the conferences of international and Japanese educational associations. Two research reports were also published : Changing School in a Changing Society (March 1999, 154pp) and A Comparison Study on Teachers' values, attitudes and life-style in Japan and China (March 2001, 169pp), both edited by Hidenori Fujita. Some of the major findings are as follows :(1) Teaching is composed of so many works and tasks both in Japan and in China, But their organization is significantly different between these two countries, reflecting historical backgrounds, cultural heritage of schooling and the stage of socio-economic and educational development of the respective country.(2) Teachers are under the heavy pressure of various requests and criticism over teaching and schooling in both countries, and teaching tends to become intensified along with the expansion of schooling and bureacratization of school administration.(3) Collegiality is institutionalized in the organization of teachers and their various roles, intermingled with a socio-cultural tradition of groupism, and is functioning to develop the culture of teaching and the ethos of teachers"

And(3) these personal interactions influenced teachers' molrale, and moreover(4) the students also expected the personal relationships with their teachers because excepting their family, they had no reliable person (adult).Based on this research, it is necessary that the teacher isn't only the person that teach the academic curriculla but also the model, the counselleror and so on"

For this purpose, we conducted two major researches : one is the questionnaire survey of 2053 teachers of 40 elementary and 38 junior high schools ; and the other is an ethnographic research at four elementary and 4 junior high schools during the 1994/5 academic year. Some members of the research team attended at two international conferences and presented the papers as well as exchanged the research findings and ideas on teaching. Some of the research results were published as several Articles of academic Journals and as a research report. Some of the major findings are as follows :(1)Teaching in Japan is composed of so many works and tasks, which keep Japanese teachers busy and result in the intensification of teaching occupation.(2)Collegiality is institutionalized in the organization of teachers and various roles, intermingled with a socio-cultural tradition of groupism, and plays both positive and negative roles for developing the teaching"
