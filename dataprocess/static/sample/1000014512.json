                        "en": "Targeting a drug on hydroxyapatite (HA) could be a promising way for selective drug delivery to bone, because HA, an inorganic component in hard tissues (bone and teeth), does not exist in soft tissues. Several bone noncollagenous proteins, which bind to HA, have repeating sequences of acidic amino acids in their structures as possible HA-binding sites. Thus, we think that a small peptide of repetitive acidic amino acid could work as a carrier for selective drug delivery to the bone. To test this hypothesis, we conjugated (Asp), to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), evaluated its affinity to HA in vitro, and examined its tissue distribution after injection into rats. Although fluorescein itself did not bind to HA, (Asp)(6)-FITC bound to WA as well as calceine and tetracycline, Twenty-four hours after intravenous injection of (Asp)(6)-FITC to rats, animals were killed, and ground sections of hard tissues and cryosections of soft tissues were made. Under a confocal laser scanning microscope, clear labeling lines were observed in bones and teeth, whereas no labeling was detected in soft tissues. In the rats administered with fluorescein alone, the fluorescent labeling was detected in neither hard nor soft tissues. Fluorescent analysis of blood, urine, and bones after (Asp)(6)-FITC administration revealed that biological half-life of FITC in blood was short (60 minutes) and that within 24 h, 95% of the administered FITC was excreted as urine whereas 2% of the FITC accumulated in bones, After subcutaneous administration of (Asp)(6)-FITC to mice, fluorescent intensity remaining in the femurs was measured periodically, In these mice the biological half-life of FITC in the femur was 14 days. Present results indicate that (Asp), is effective as a carrier for selective drug delivery to bone."

                        "en": "Successive injections of 1-hydroxyethplidene-1,l-bisphosphonate (HEBP) in rats induce enamel hypoplasia. To elucidate the pathogenesis of this hypoplasia, male Wistar rats were daily injected with HEBP or physiological saline for 7 days. After the last injection, they were killed under anaesthesia and their maxillary incisors were examined using an in situ hybridization technique and immunohistochemical staining to detect the gene expression and localization of amelogenin protein, respectively. In the HEBP-injected rats, several islets of partially mineralized enamel were present along crown-analogous surface of the incisor in the secretory stage of amelogenesis and enamel-free zones existed between these islets. In situ hybridization demonstrated amelogenin gene expression over the ameloblasts facing the islets of the matrix enamel as well as over those of the enamel-free zones. Immunohistochemical studies using rabbit antiamelognin antibody revealed positive reaction both in the enamel matrix of the control group and in the islets of enamel matrix of the HEBP-injected group. Some small granules immunoreactive to amelogenin antibody were found in the distal portions of the ameloblasts in the HEBP-injected rats. The results indicate that HEBP does not alter amelogenin gene expression over ameloblasts. or the protein's existence in enamel matrix. There appeared to be some accumulation of amelogenin in the HEBP-treated ameloblasts. It is therefore suggested that the enamel hypoplasia in this experiment may not be due to a disturbance in amelogenin synthesis but to a disturbance in a later process, presumably of protein secretion.

                        "en": "Low-calcium-fed animals have been accepted as one of the experimental models showing a reduction in bone mass. However, the effects of short-term low-calcium feeding on bone turnover, the development of osteoprogenitor cells, and gene expression of bone matrix proteins have not been reported. In this study, we examined the effect of a low-calcium diet on rat tibia and analyzed the changes in the bone by histomorphometry, bone marrow cell culture, and in situ and Northern hybridization of the bone matrix proteins. Rats were fed either a low-calcium diet (0.05% Ca) or a normal calcium diet (0.5% Ca) using the pair feeding technique. They were killed at day 0, 12 h, and days 1, 2, and 3, In the low-calcium group, the serum parathyroid hormone (PTR) level was temporarily increased in 12 h after feeding the low-calcium diet. Bone mineral density in the trabecular bone was significantly decreased from 1 day after the low-calcium feeding, but cortical bone did not show any changes during the experimental period. The bone volume per tissue volume in the proximal tibia also decreased from day 1 in the low-calcium group. The number of osteoclasts and osteoblasts on the trabecular bone surface was increased in the low-calcium group compared with the normal-calcium group. An ex vivo study showed that the number of progenitors of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in bone marrow was also increased in the low-calcium group of rats. The localization of type I collagen mRNA was observed in osteoblasts in the low-calcium group. The Northern hybridization study showed that the gene expression of type I collagen, osteopontin, and osteocalcin was increased at day 3 in the low-calcium group. These results indicated that the trabecular bone surface quickly responded to the low-calcium feeding and that bone remodeling activity was activated probably by PTH, The changes in bone marrow cell populations and the gene expression of bone matrix proteins are closely associated with increased bone turnover induced by the low-calcium diet, resulting in rapid bone loss of the trabecular bone.

                        "en": "Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4), a member of the FGF family, plays several important roles in bone development during embryogenesis. Systemic administration of FGF4 increases bone mass in rats, which suggests the potential therapeutic usefulness of this growth factor in treatment for osteopenia and in bone regeneration. We investigated the length of FGF4 required to exert its anabolic effects, because this information may be useful in developing new molecules to mimic the effects of FGF4, Because the active site of FGF family molecules is in the carboxylterminal region, we produced aminoterminally truncated recombinant human FGF4s (rhFGF4s) of different sizes. Humam FGF4 cDNA containing almost the full length of the coding region (573 bp, 191 amino acid residues) was inserted into pUC18 vector and then deleted from the 5' end using the ExoIII system. Each of the deleted FGF4 cDNAs was subcloned into a pET29(+) expression vector. Differently sized recombinant proteins were expressed in the BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli strain and then purified. The growth-stimulative effects on NIH3T3 cells of each recombinant protein were examined by means of MTT colorimetric assay. Full-length and the shortened recombinant proteins, which stimulated NIH3T3 cell growth, were then subcutaneously administered into male ddY mice (6 weeks old) every day for 2 weeks. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), The rhFGF4 of 134 amino acid residues, the region homologous to other members of the FGF family, exerted a growth-stimulative effect on NIH3T3 cells comparable to the full-length version of FGF4; however, the shortest version, with 111 amino acid residues, showed a limited growth-stimulative effect. Systemic administration of the rhFGF4 of 134 amino acid residues increased the bone mineral density (BMD) of femurs at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, which was comparable to that of the full-length rhFGF4, DEXA analysis, pQCT analysis, soft X-ray photos, and contact microradiographs revealed an increase in femoral trabecular bone in FGF4-treated animals; an increase in bone formation was also evident upon histomorphometric analysis. These results indicate that the region of FGF4 that is homologous to other FGF family members provides a sufficient anabolic effect in bone and that this recombinant protein is potentially useful as a therapeutic agent in bone, (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc. an rights reserved."

                        "en": "Naturally occuring inactivating mutations of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) in mice give rise to the motheaten (me) phenotype, me/me mice have multiple hematopoietic abnormalities, suggesting that this phosphatase plays an important role in hematopoiesis. SHP-1 binds to and is activated by several hematopoietic surface receptors, including the colony-stimulating factor type 1 receptor. We have examined the role of SHP-1 in osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function using mice with the viable motheaten (me(nu)/me(nu) ) mutation, which has markedly decreased SHP-1 activity. Histomorphometric analysis of 6-week-old me(nu)/me(nu) mice and control littermates showed a marked osteopenia with an increase in bone resorption indices. The number of formed osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) in cocultures of me(nu)/me(nu) hematopoietic cells with normal osteoblasts was significantly increased. In contrast, the number of OCLs formed in the coculture of normal bone marrow cells with the me(nu)/me(nu) osteoblasts was not significantly different from controls. The bone-resorbing activity of me(nu)/me(nu) OCLs and authentic osteoclasts was also found to be increased. Finally, Western blotting of proteins from me(nu)/me(nu) and control OCLs revealed an overall increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in the me(nu)/me(nu) lysates. These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that SHP-1 is a negative regulator of bone resorption, affecting both the formation and the function of osteoclasts. (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc.

The 24-h urinary excretions of the crosslinks in diabetic rats increased in a biphasic manner after STZ-injection. The first peak appeared during the day after the STZ-injection, i.e., 53% higher than control for Pyr and 62% higher for D-Pyr and the second peak appeared during the second week after the STZ-injection, being 56% higher for Pyr and 81% higher for D-Pyr. The urinary excretions of glycosides, however, were almost the same level as those of the control throughout the experimental period (6 weeks). In normal rats, the ratio of the crosslinks to the glycosides in urine was found to be lower than that in serum. This suggests that the selective reabsorption of the crosslinks occurs in the rat kidney. The apparent increased urinary excretion of pyridinolines in diabetic rats might be ascribed to the disorder of the renal reabsorption."

Furthermore, osteoporosis-like changes in the femurs and decrease in uterus weight were observed, as previously reported for W256/S-bearing young rats. In the healthy mature female rats, the estrus cycle passed through four stages (proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus) within 4 to 5 days, with a peak of serum estradiol and progesterone levels in the proestrus stage. On the other hand, after subcutaneous inoculation of W256/S into the rats, the estrus cycle tended to pause upon the metestrus or diestrus stage, accompanied with significantly low estradiol and progesterone levels in serum. W256/S tumor produced and secreted luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH). In conclusion, it seems that the ectopical secretion of LH-RH from the tumor resulted in the decrease in the secretion of gonadotropic hormones, following low level of sex hormones and stopping the estrus cycle. Therefore, W256/S-bearing rats may be a model for osteoporosis of hypoovarianism or postmenopause."

In the present study, effects of a new PDE4 inhibitor, 1-n-butyl-3-n-propylxanthine (XT-44), in bone were evaluated in cell cultures and animal experiments. In rat bone marrow culture, XT-44 stimulated mineralized-nodule formation, whereas it inhibited osteoclast-like cell formation in mouse bone marrow culture. In Walker256/S-bearing rats (6-week-old female Wistar Imamichi rats), rapid decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) was prominent, and oral administration of XT-44 (0.3 mg/kg, every 2 days) inhibited the decrease in BMD. In the second animal experiment, female Wistar rats (6-week-old) were sciatic neurectomized, and XT-44 was orally administered to these rats every 2 days for 4 weeks. XT-44 administration (0.3 mg/kg) recovered BMD in these neurectomized animals. Furthermore, 19-week-old, female Wistar rats were ovariectomized (OVX), and 15 weeks after surgery, these rats were orally administered XT-44 every 2 days for 8 weeks. XT-44 treatment (1 mg/kg) increased the BMD of OVX rats. These results indicate that XT-44 could be a candidate as a therapeutic drug for treating osteopenia including osteoporosis."

                        "en": "We have shown that Walker 256/S mammary carcinoma caused osteoporosis-like changes in young female rats, accompanied by low serum estradiol and hypercalciuria without changes in the serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone-related peptide. In this study, we investigated the cause of bone loss after Walker 256/S inoculation into female 6-week-old Wistar Imamichi rats, focusing on the sex hormone balance in the host animal. Walker 256/S-bearing rats showed characteristic osteoporosis, with a significant increase in spleen weight and a significant decrease in uterine weight by 14 days after s.c. tumor inoculation. In the in vitro bone marrow culture, mineralized nodule formation ability decreased according to the time after tumor inoculation, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cell formation increased at 7 days after tumor inoculation, but it began to decrease at 14 days after tumor inoculation. This indicates that after inoculation with Walker 256/S tumor, the progenitors of osteoblasts and ostroclasts lost their balance in the bone turnover, resulting in bone resorption. On the other hand, Walker 256/S carcinoma expressed luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) mRNA, and in Walker 256/S-bearing rats, the serum LH-RH Level increased significantly from 3 days after tumor inoculation, whereas in the healthy control rats, this level was very low. Consequently, the serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, Luteinizing hormone, estradiol, and progesterone were significantly lower in the tumor-bearing rats than in the healthy control rats. Because the LH-RH gene is located in the Long prolactin release-inhibiting factor (PIF) gene and mRNA amplified by reverse transcription-PCR in this study contained whole LH-RH and a part of PIF, the Walker 256/S tumor is thought to express PIF, Indeed, the serum prolactin Level decreased in tumor-bearing rats. The serum level of growth hormone, one of the other pituitary hormones, was not changed. Moreover, the level of an osteolytic cytokine, tumor necrosis factor cu, increased in the serum of Walker 256/S-bearing rats, although this may be a result of the immune response of the host animal to tumor growth as well as an enlarged spleen. In conclusion, the Walker 256/S tumor lowers estrogen secretion through ectopical oversecretion of LH-RH, and then osteolytic cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, increase in tumor-bearing rats, escape the control of estrogen, and activate osteoclasts, resulting in bone loss in a short period."

S100A4 is expressed in several tissues; however, it is secreted by few cell types and its extracellular roles are unknown. In the present study we showed by in situ hybridization that periodontal ligament (PDL) cells express the S100A4 mRNA, Immunolocalization of the S100A4 protein in cryosections of PDL and analyses of PDL cell culture medium revealed that PDL cells secrete the S100A4 protein both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, addition of a recombinant mouse S100A4 protein to a bone marrow cell culture inhibited mineralized nodule formation in a concentration-dependent manner. This is the first report of an extracellular role for S100A4 as an inhibitor of mineralization. The PDL space is kept free of mineralization and S100A4 may be one of the factors responsible for such phenomenon. (C) 1999 Academic Press."

                        "en": "The ability of cadmium (Cd) to induce the synthesis of metallothionein (MT) in the developing teeth of the rat was investigated. Rats were given daily intraperitoneal injections of cadmium chloride (1.5 mg Cd/kg) for 7 days. The induction of MT synthesis in incisor teeth after Cd treatment was investigated immunohistochemically using a polyclonal antibody to MT, Immunoreactivity to MT was observed in the papillary layer of epithelial cells of the secretory zone, in one layer of epithelial cells of the presecretory zone and within ameloblasts of the postsecretory zone. Normal control rats did not exhibit MT staining. These results indicate that Cd induces MT synthesis within specific epithelial cells of the enamel organ of the rat. It is proposed that these findings demonstrate an adaptive cellular mechanism that protects these cells from cadmium toxicity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism of mechanotransduction in bone cells. Osteoblastic cells, KUSA cells, were loaded with fluorescent Ca^<2+>-sensitive fluo-3 AM dye, and exposed to fluid-shear stress in a flow chamber. Stimulus-induced changes in the fluorescence intensity were measured using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Application of flow to the cells led to an increase in fluorescence, which declined by stopping the flow. Blockade of the mechanosensory stretch-activated channel by gadolinium reduced the magnitude of the calcium response induced by the fluid flow and extended the latency of the reaction. Disruption of the actin filament by cytochalasin D did not show any inhibitory effect on the magnitude of the calcium response, but the latency was shortened. From these results, we concluded that the stretch-activated channel is involved in the fluid-induced intracellular calcium response in the osteoblastic cells, and that actin filaments modulate the sensitivity of the stretch-activated channel.",

                        "en": "The periodontal ligament (PDL) functions under constant mechanical stress, and PDL cells obviously control PDL functions under such conditions. We have previously found that the mRNA expression of the Ca 2+-binding protein S100A4 and β-actin is higher in the PDL from erupted teeth than in the PDL from teeth under eruption. This suggested a role for S100A4 in the response of PDL cells to mechanical stress, possibly by coupling Ca 2+ and the cytoskeletal system. In the present study, we investigated the direct effects of cyclical stretching on the mRNA expression of S100A4 and two cytoskeletal components (β-actin and α-tubulin) by PDL cells. In Northern blotting analysis, the expression of S100A4, β-actin, and α-tubulin mRNAs was higher in the PDL from fully erupted and functional bovine teeth than in partially erupted ones. Similarly, when bovine PDL cells were mechanically stimulated by means of the Flexercell Strain Unit, the expression of S100A4, β-actin, and α-tubulin mRNAs increased over the control levels. The results of our present study indicate that S100A4 is involved in the responses of PDL cells to mechanical stress possibly by cou-pling Ca 2+ to the cytoskeletal system in these cells."
