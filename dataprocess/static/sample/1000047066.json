The last specimen is called the surface removed specimen and its surface layer was removed 0.1 mm in radius after nitriding. The fatigue limit of the nitrided specimen was higher than that of the annealed specimen, but was almost the same as that of the surface removed specimen. This is related to the hardness distribution of the specimen. In the case of the nitrided specimen, the hardness is recorded maximum at the surface layer and decreased in the internal section. The estimated strength from the hardness of that specimen is higher than the measured fatigue limit within the 0.1 mm thickness layer from the surface. At the internal section deeper than 0.1 mm from the surface, the estimated strength is expected to be lower than the fatigue limit. Thus the fatigue limit and strength of the nitrided specimen are determined by the material properties of internal site. So, the fatigue limit and strength of the nitrided specimen are not decreased even if the surface layer is removed. In the case of the nitrided specimen, the crack was difficult to be observed from the surface because the crack initiation occurred from the internal site. To remove the surface layer makes ease to observe the crack on the surface. In the case of the surface removed specimen, many cracks were initiated and propagate along the needle shaped participate Fe_4N and finaly these cracks made coalescence each other. The similar mechanism is expected to be operated at the internal site of the nitrided specimen from the observation of the fracture surfaces.",

The last specimen is called the surface removed specimen and its surface layer was removed 0.1 mm in radius after nitriding. The fatigue limit of the nitrided specimen was higher than that of the annealed specimen, but was almost the same as that of the surface removed specimen. This is related to the hardness distribution of the specimen. In the case of the nitrided specimen, the hardness is recorded maximum at the surface layer and decreased in the internal section. The estimated strength from the hardness of that specimen is higher than the measured fatigue limit within the 0.1 mm thickness layer from the surface. At the internal section deeper than 0.1 mm from the surface, the estimated strength is expected to be lower than the fatigue limit. Thus the fatigue limit and strength of the nitrided specimen are determined by the material properties of internal site. So, the fatigue limit and strength of the nitrided specimen are not decreased even if the surface layer is removed. In the case of the nitrided specimen, the crack was difficult to be observed from the surface because the crack initiation occurred from the internal site. To remove the surface layer makes ease to observe the crack on the surface. In the case of the surface removed specimen, many cracks were initiated and propagate along the needle shaped participate Fe_4N and finaly these cracks made coalescence each other. The similar mechanism is expected to be operated at the internal site of the nitrided specimen from the observation of the fracture surfaces.",

It is found that the fatigue limit of the nitrided rolled specimens is much higher than that of the nitrided annealed ones and the substructures before the nitriding are effective for the improvement of the fatigue strength. The substructure of the rolled steel consists of cells with dislocation clusters within them. By means of nitriding treatment, cell structures and twins appear in the inner part of the compound layer, while uniformly distributed dislocation clusters in the region just below the compound layer and the inner part of the diffusion layer. After fatigue test, most of these substructures are preserved except for the region just below the compound layer where the cell structures due to active dislocation motions were formed."

                        "en": "The fatigue crack propagation law was investigated for the two cases of crack propagation in a region of welding residual stress and after overloading. In the former case, the crack propagation rate da/dN was found to depend on the stress ratio R defined by sigma(min)/sigma(max) where sigma(min), sigma(max) , are the minimum and maximum cyclic stresses. Due to the tensile residual stress, the crack propagation rate increased as the stress ratio decreased in the range -2 less than or equal to R less than or equal to 0. In the latter case, the crack propagation rate da/dN after overloading was higher than that for the constant stress amplitude test at first and then became lower. The crack propagation rate was thus affected by both the residual stress and the overloading. However, the crack propagation behavior correlated well with the crack closure behavior. Therefore, in the cases considered here, the crack propagation law can be reasonably evaluated from the effective stress intensity factor range Delta K-eff."

From the observations of the surface crack and fracture surface, it is found that fatigue crack initiation and early-stage crack growth mechanisms of annealed bulk copper are not necessarily applicable to those of film. No striations are formed in both films. In annealed films, cell structures are formed under high-cycle fatigue whereas no band/ladder structures are formed. Dislocation structures near the fatigue crack in annealed films are similar to those of bulk specimens except for the absence of intensely elongated cells observed in the shear flow regions in the bulk specimen. No appreciable change during fatigue was found in the dislocation structures of rolled films.",

The function h1 can be used to substitute for the load parameter and the waveform of h2 changes its shape after the crack initiation due to the crack closure behavior. Therefore, we can detect the fatigue crack initiation at the hole by comparison of these two waveforms. Also, these waveforms are analyzed with FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) to allow for a more effective detection of crack initiation. Power spectrum density of the waveform h2 varies immediately when the crack length measured from hole edge reaches about 0.5 mm. The figures showing the coherence of two waveforms h1 and h2 clearly vary at the same length 0.5 mm.

The waveform of the strain function composed of strains in the vicinity of the partial notch was observed successionally. It is found that such strain waveform changes its figure at the time when the crack length is 1 mm, due to the crack closure behavior. Therefore, in this experiment, the crack initiation could be detected when the crack length is about 1 mm. Since the engineering crack initiation size is frequently taken to be 1 mm, the present method of detecting crack initiation can be applied to real machine equipment. Also, this waveform was analyzed with FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation). Power spectrum density of the waveform varies immediately after the crack length reaches 1 mm. Furthermore, the figure of the coherence of two waveforms composed of the same strains clearly varies at the same crack length of 1 mm. Thus, it is thought that the engineering size crack initiation can be detected by the analysis of the strain waveform."

The strains on the center axis of the hole are used for the determination of the strain function h. The crack initiation can be detected using the waveform of the strain function h. The waveform of h of the precracking can be distinguished from that of the postcracking. The depth of penetration of the crack into the specimen thickness can also be inspected using the waveform of the strain function h. Such variations of the waveform are based on the crack tip opening and closing behavior. Furthermore, the approximate estimation of crack length is carried out using the waveform of the strain function hh measured at the maximum stress point."
