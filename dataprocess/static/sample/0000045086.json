                        "en": "We have developed a simple method for rapid detection of mycoplasma contamination in cell cultures using SYBR Green-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To detect eight common contaminant mollicutes, including Mycoplasma (M. arginini, M. fermentans, M. orale, M. hyorhinis, M. hominis, M. salivarium, M. pirum) and Acholeplasma laidlawii, four primers were prepared based on the 23S rRNA regions. Using these primers and a minimum of 100 fg of mycoplasma genomic DNA, the 23S rRNA regions of these eight mycoplasma species were consistently amplified by real-time PCR. In contrast, no specific amplification product was observed using DNA templates prepared from various mammalian cell lines. Frozen and cultured samples of several cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination to evaluate the utility of this method. Of 25 samples that tested positive for mycoplasma by Hoechst staining, which requires two passages of cell cultures started from frozen samples, mycoplasma was detected by real-time PCR in 24 samples of cell extracts prepared directly from frozen samples. When cultured samples were used for this assay, the accuracy of the diagnoses was further improved. Thus, this technique, which is simple, rapid, and sensitive enough for practical application, is suitable for handling many samples and for routine screening for mycoplasma contamination of cell cultures."

                        "en": "This paper reviews the local hormone endothelin-2 (ET-2), or vasoactive intestinal contractor (VIC), a member of the vasoconstrictor ET peptide family, where ET-2 is the human orthologous peptide of the murine VIC. While ET-2/VIC gene expression has been observed in some normal tissues, ET-2 recently has been reported to act as a tumor marker and as a hypoxia-induced autocrine survival factor in tumor cells. A recently published study reported that the hypoxic mimetic agent CoCl2 at 200 mu M increased expression of the ET-2/VIC gene, decreased expression of the ET-1 gene, and induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase and neurite outgrowth in neuronal model PC12 cells. The ROS was generated by addition of CoCl2 to the culture medium, and the CoCl2-induced effects were completely inhibited by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. Furthermore, interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression was up-regulated on the differentiation induced by CoCl2. These results suggest that expression of ET-2/VIC and ET-1 mediated by CoCl2- induced ROS may be associated with neuronal differentiation through the regulation of IL-6 expression. CoCl2 acts as a pro-oxidant, as do Fe(II, III) and Cu(II). However, some biological activities have been reported for CoCl2 that have not been observed for other metal salts such as FeCl3, CuSO4, and NiCl2. The characteristic actions of CoCl2 may be associated with the differentiation of PC12 cells. Further elucidation of the mechanism of neurite outgrowth and regulation of ET-2/VIC expression by CoCl2 may lead to the development of treatments for neuronal disorders.."

                        "en": "Previous studies on human uterine and placental tissues have found variants, derived from alternatively spliced mRNAs, of preproendothelin-2 (PPET2) that lack a post-translational proteolytic site essential for normal processing. Here we report a splice variant of cat PPET2 mRNA expressed in the stomach. After cloning the full-length cDNA of cat PPET2, organ distribution analysis of the transcript by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed. In addition to the fragment with a size predicted based on the cDNA sequence obtained by cloning, an additional PCR fragment of smaller size was detected in stomach tissue. Subsequent cloning and sequence analysis of the smaller PCR product demonstrated that it derives from a splice variant with full-length deletion of a region corresponding to exon 4 of the PPET2 gene."

In contrast, ET-1-like immunoreactivity was uniformly distributed in epithelial cells. In dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, colonic ET-2 was upregulated during the late stage of DSS treatment. These results suggest that in intestinal epithelial cells ET-2 could be secreted into the lamina propria and the dome region in Peyer's patch, and that it might modulate immune cells in these sites for mucosal defense."

RT-PCR analysis, morphological observations, and immunostaining revealed that CoCl2, a hypoxic mimetic agent, at 200 mu M increased expression of the ET-2/VIC gene, decreased expression of the ET-1 gene, and induced neurite outgrowth in PC-12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. These effects induced by 200 mu M CoCl2 were completely inhibited by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine at 20 mM. In addition, CoCl2 increased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) at an early stage. Furthermore, interleukin (IL)-6 gene expression was upregulated upon the differentiation induced by CoCl2. These results suggest that expression of ET-2/VIC and ET-1 mediated by ROS may be associated with neuronal differentiation through the regulation of IL-6. When the cells were treated with 500 PM CoCl2 for 24 hr, however, ET-2/VIC gene expression disappeared, IL-6 gene expression was downregulated, and necrosis was subsequently induced in the PC-12 cells.

                        "en": "We investigated whether endothelin-2/vasoactive intestinal contractor (ET-2/VIC) gene expression, upregulated by hypoxia in cancer cells, was associated with differentiation in neuronal cells. RT-PCR analysis, morphological observations, and immunostaining revealed that CoCl2, a hypoxic mimetic agent, at 200 mu M increased expression of the ET-2/VIC gene, decreased expression of the ET-1 gene, and induced neurite outgrowth in PC-12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. These effects induced by 200 mu M CoCl2 were completely inhibited by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine at 20 mM. In addition, CoCl2 increased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) at an early stage. Furthermore, interleukin (IL)-6 gene expression was upregulated upon the differentiation induced by CoCl2. These results suggest that expression of ET-2/VIC and ET-1 mediated by ROS may be associated with neuronal differentiation through the regulation of IL-6. When the cells were treated with 500 PM CoCl2 for 24 hr, however, ET-2/VIC gene expression disappeared, IL-6 gene expression was downregulated, and necrosis was subsequently induced in the PC-12 cells.

The biological actions of ET are similar in amphibians and mammals, and amphibian ET-related receptors have been cloned and characterized. The cDNA sequences of mature and precursor forms of ET-related peptides, however, have not been reported in any amphibian until now. To identify the ET-related peptides, we screened the Xenopus laevis intestine cDNA library using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method and cloned cDNAs encoding preproendothelin-1. The deduced amino acid sequence of X. laevis preproendothelin-1 comprises 223 amino acids, including a putative signal sequence of 19 amino acids, a mature ET-1 of 21 amino acids, as well as big ET-1 and ET-1-like sequences. X. laevis ET-1 is identical to mammalian ET-1 as well as ET-1 peptide, recently purified from the stomach of the European green frog, Rana ridibunda. This is the first report describing the cDNA encoding preproendothelin-1 in an amphibian species."

                        "en": "We cloned and characterized horse preproendothelin-2 (PPET-2) cDNA from intestinal tissue. The cDNA encoded 178 amino acids of the PPET-2 polypeptide, in which a 21-amino-acid mature endothelin-2 peptide and a 16-amino acid endothelin-2-like peptide were found. For the open reading frame the correspondence of horse PPET-2 cDNA with those of the ferret, human, dog, mouse and rat was 85.1%, 84.9%, 82.1%, 77.8% and 77.2%, respectively. Analysis of the organ distribution of PPET-2 mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the kidney, stomach and small intestine are major sites of expression of the PPET-2 gene. Surprisingly, the mRNA is not detected in the large intestine, where high expression is demonstrated in the mouse and rat. This difference may result from the underlying functional differences of the large intestine between a herbivore (horse) and an omnivore (mouse and rat)."
