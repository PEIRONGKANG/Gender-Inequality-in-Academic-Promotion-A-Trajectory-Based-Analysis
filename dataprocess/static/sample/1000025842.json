                        "ja": "After the war, the outline of the occupation policy of the Allies was instituted in promoting Japan's demilitarization and emocratization. As for physical education and sports, the sports that were regarded as ones to further democratization replaced military training and Budo, and they were promoted. It was essential for this promotion to supply sporting goods that were in great demand in those days in Japan. The purpose of this study was to clarify the measures taken by the CIE to supply sporting goods in Japan under the occupation, focusing on the activities of CIE officers regarding physical education. The process was examined through an analysis of the documents of the GHQ/SCAP. The results of this study are summarized as follows:1)The CIE officer for physical education (J.W.Norviel) worked actively on this issue. He began to conduct research and studies on sporting goods in February 1946 and drew up a supply plan for sporting goods over the next 15 months at the conference in September of that year. This plan was sufficiently systematic and concrete to guide the production of the goods of sports events to which priority should be given and to determine the amount of this production. The plan was controlled, and it provided an economic policy for that time. This plan placed goods of baseball, which has been popular among Japanese, and simple games introduced after the war, as the higher priority sporting goods.2)This plan, however, was not pursued smoothly from the beginning. The major factors found were the following : One was the critical shortage of materials, such as leather, rubber, and textile required for production of these goods in Japan at that time. In addition, these scarce materials were also wanted by other industries. Another was Japan's stagnating economic conditions after the war. Therefore, the officers (J.W.Norviel and W.J.Graham) expended their efforts in securing materials required for the production of sporting goods, by using goods the U.S.military had parted with and by studying substitute goods.

                        "en": "After the war, the outline of the occupation policy of the Allies was instituted in promoting Japan's demilitarization and emocratization. As for physical education and sports, the sports that were regarded as ones to further democratization replaced military training and Budo, and they were promoted. It was essential for this promotion to supply sporting goods that were in great demand in those days in Japan. The purpose of this study was to clarify the measures taken by the CIE to supply sporting goods in Japan under the occupation, focusing on the activities of CIE officers regarding physical education. The process was examined through an analysis of the documents of the GHQ/SCAP. The results of this study are summarized as follows:1)The CIE officer for physical education (J.W.Norviel) worked actively on this issue. He began to conduct research and studies on sporting goods in February 1946 and drew up a supply plan for sporting goods over the next 15 months at the conference in September of that year. This plan was sufficiently systematic and concrete to guide the production of the goods of sports events to which priority should be given and to determine the amount of this production. The plan was controlled, and it provided an economic policy for that time. This plan placed goods of baseball, which has been popular among Japanese, and simple games introduced after the war, as the higher priority sporting goods.2)This plan, however, was not pursued smoothly from the beginning. The major factors found were the following : One was the critical shortage of materials, such as leather, rubber, and textile required for production of these goods in Japan at that time. In addition, these scarce materials were also wanted by other industries. Another was Japan's stagnating economic conditions after the war. Therefore, the officers (J.W.Norviel and W.J.Graham) expended their efforts in securing materials required for the production of sporting goods, by using goods the U.S.military had parted with and by studying substitute goods. They handled even the black market, which also created an important problem in supplying sporting goods. However, the delay in the import of the materials, inadequate responses to the black market, and the lack of facilities and funds of the Japanese sporting goods manufactures hindered the plan in being pursued smoothly.3) No long-term supply plans of sporting goods have been seen since 1948. It should be considered that the supply plans were developed according to conditions of scarce materials and needs for sporting products. These plans gave consideration to the traditional supply conditions of placing excessive emphasis on baseball goods and the shortage of school sports goods, and made reviews of the supply of sporting products.

This study analyzed articles of 'Nihon Undogu Shinpo', which is a sporting-goods trade newspaper first published in Japan from 1948 to 1956, by using the historical research method. First, the postwar reconstruction of the sporting-goods business was started by the establishment of sporting-goods manufacture industrial organizations, classified by the production materials of leather, lumber, metal and fiber. Sporting-goods makers had to unite as an organization, in order to supply good quality sporting-goods immediately. Although the organization which managed the distribution of gymnastics and sports materials under the wartime economy control policy was abolished in 1948, this required a new system which could assume the role of adjustment of the demand and supply for sporting-goods. While sporting-goods wholesale organizations were born as a result, and they were aimed at the adjustment of relations between the sporting-goods manufacturers and the sporting-goods retailers, these developments had a strong influence on both. Although economic controls were eased after 1949, a high commodity tax was still imposed on sporting-goods. In order to get rid of such a situation, a new organization which unified makers, wholesalers and retailers concerned with sporting-goods was founded. This organization developed an active political campaign for the abolition of the economic controls and the unification of the whole sporting-goods industry. Thus, there were both cooperation and resistance in regard to the postwar economic policy in the establishment of a sporting-goods industrial organization. It is a notable feature of Japan' s sporting-goods industry structure that the sporting-goods wholesale industry was able to manage the adjustment of these two sides.",

The process is examined through an analysis of thesporting goods trade newspaper 'Nihon Undogu Shipo'. The results of this study are summarised as follows: 1) When the wartime rationing organization of sporting goods was abolished in May, 1948 and the new one was set up, the change was appraised as the first step to free business. At the same time, owing to the enactment of the Antitrust Act, the restrictions of the new participation in retail were mitigated. 2) The idea of the so-called three strata structure of maker-wholesaler-retailer, which was later formed, had already been established in the same period. The energy to form the strata came from the political activities that demanded the deregulation of the supply of sporting goods and the abolishment of the commodity tax on sporting goods. As the result of these activities, the regulation was gradually abolished by 1956 and the tax was also reduced on a step-by-step basis. The cause of deregulating the sporting goods business was not only the increase of supply but also the difficulty of the planned rationing system. 3) The retailers' cooperative associations had not been so active until they intended to protect their 'right to trade' by facing the threat of department stores and co-op stores around 1954-1955. As most of the retailers were small retail merchants, they sometimes lacked the knowledge of how to train an efficient staff of business. But by 1953 it was emphasized that clerks shouldered the management of their stores and therefore the business policy had to be brought home to them.",

The relationship between the sporting goods industry and sports athletic organizations in the postwar period was to work in close cooperation. Both had problems of getting good sporting equipment and financial guarantees. 2. The system of officially recognized sporting equipment was developed to remedy these two problems. Table tennis is a good example of this, but the case of volleyball shows a conflict among the sporting goods industries. 3. Unity among three sporting goods industry organizations was achieved in about 1953. This unity began to demand a fair system of officially recognized sporting equipment for the development of sports, with the raising of official recognition fees for volleyball. 4. This Unity influenced the revision of amateur regulations in 1957.",

The process is examined through an analysis of thesporting goods trade newspaper 'Nihon Undogu Shipo'. The results of this study are summarised as follows: 1) When the wartime rationing organization of sporting goods was abolished in May, 1948 and the new one was set up, the change was appraised as the first step to free business. At the same time, owing to the enactment of the Antitrust Act, the restrictions of the new participation in retail were mitigated. 2) The idea of the so-called three strata structure of maker-wholesaler-retailer, which was later formed, had already been established in the same period. The energy to form the strata came from the political activities that demanded the deregulation of the supply of sporting goods and the abolishment of the commodity tax on sporting goods. As the result of these activities, the regulation was gradually abolished by 1956 and the tax was also reduced on a step-by-step basis. The cause of deregulating the sporting goods business was not only the increase of supply but also the difficulty of the planned rationing system. 3) The retailers' cooperative associations had not been so active until they intended to protect their 'right to trade' by facing the threat of department stores and co-op stores around 1954-1955. As most of the retailers were small retail merchants, they sometimes lacked the knowledge of how to train an efficient staff of business. But by 1953 it was emphasized that clerks shouldered the management of their stores and therefore the business policy had to be brought home to them.",

The items of the trade paper \"Nihon Undogu Sinpo\" from 1948-1956 were used as historical materials for this study.The conclusions of this study are as follows: 1. The relationship between the sporting goods industry and sports athletic organizations in the postwar period was to work in close cooperation. Both had problems of getting good sporting equipment and financial guarantees. 2. The system of officially recognized sporting equipment was developed to remedy these two problems. Table tennis is a good example of this, but the case of volleyball shows a conflict among the sporting goods industries. 3. Unity among three sporting goods industry organizations was achieved in about 1953. This unity began to demand a fair system of officially recognized sporting equipment for the development of sports, with the raising of official recognition fees for volleyball. 4. This Unity influenced the revision of amateur regulations in 1957.",
