                        "en": "We studied differences in nitrogen uptake and use for plant growth among individuals competing in a natural dense stand of an annual herb, Xanthium canadense. Larger individuals took up more nitrogen than proportionately to their size, indicating that the competition for soil nitrogen was asymmetric among individuals, although it was more symmetric than the competition for light. The rate of nitrogen loss of individuals also increased with plant size. While smaller individuals shared smaller fractions of total plant nitrogen in the stand, they had higher nitrogen concentrations per unit mass. \"Turnover\" rates of nitrogen influx (r(in)) and outflux (r(out)) were defined as the rates of nitrogen uptake and loss per unit aboveground nitrogen, respectively. ri, was higher in larger individuals, whereas r(out) was higher in smaller individuals. Consequently, the relative rate of nitrogen increment (r(in)-r(out)) was higher in larger individuals, whereas it was around zero in the smallest individuals. The mean residence time of nitrogen (MRT), defined as the inverse of r(out), was longer in larger individuals. Nitrogen productivity (NP), i.e. the growth rate per unit aboveground nitrogen, was higher in larger individuals. As the product of lifetime MRT and NP gives the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), defined as biomass production per unit flux of nitrogen, higher MRT and NP observed in larger individuals would have contributed to their higher lifetime NUE. Shorter MRT in smaller individuals was caused by the abscission of leaves which contained relatively large fractions of total plant nitrogen. Xanthium canadense, as a competitive ruderal, tended to produce leaves at higher positions to acquire higher light levels at the expense of older leaves rather than to modify their productive structure to efficiently use low light levels as observed in shade-tolerant species."

We investigated eight evergreen broad-leaved woody species with different leaf life spans that coexist in a warm-temperate forest. We determined photosynthetic capacity at ambient CO2 concentration in saturated light, nitrogen concentration, and the concentration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase), a key enzyme of photosynthesis and the largest sink of nitrogen in leaves. Each species showed a strong correlation between photosynthetic capacity and RuBPCase concentration, and between RuBPCase concentration and nitrogen concentration. Photosynthetic capacity of leaves decreased with increasing leaf life span, whereas PNUE did not correlate significantly with leaf life span. There was a two-fold variation in PNUE among species. This relatively small variation in PNUE is consistent with the argument that species that coexist in a single habitat maintain a similar PNUE. The two components of PNUE-photosynthetic rate per unit RuBPCase and RuBPCase per unit leaf nitrogen-were not significantly correlated with other leaf characteristics such as leaf life span and leaf mass per area. We conclude that differences in PNUE are relatively small among coexisting species and that differences in absolute amounts of photosynthetic proteins lead to differences in photosynthetic productivity among species."

A canopy model was developed to calculate light absorption by individual shoots, Light absorption per unit mass (Phi(mass)) was used to quantify the efficiency with which plants utilized biomass to capture light.\n3 The leaf mass ratio (LMR), average specific leaf area (SLA) and therefore the leaf area ratio (LAR) decreased with shoot height and light availability. Light absorption per unit leaf area (Phi(area)) increased with shoot height, and this increase was observed to be much stronger at greater than at smaller shoot heights.\n4 In the taller species (Miscanthus and Lespedeza) Phi(mass) (the product of LAR and Phi(area)) increased, while in the shortest species (Potentilla) it decreased with shoot height. Clones of Miscanthus and Lespedeza may thus increase total light capture by allocating shoot biomass among fewer taller shoots, and a clone of Potentilla by producing a larger number of shorter shoots.\n5 Shoots of the shorter species were equally efficient in capturing light (i.e. they had similar Phi(mass)) early in the season, but less efficient later in the season than shoots of the taller species. Shorter species appear to be able to use the earlier part of the season for efficient light capturer while shoots of taller species gain an advantage from their height later in the season.\n6 This study shows how different above-ground growth patterns of the species in a tall-grass meadow allow them to use different positions in vertical space and different periods of the season to absorb light efficiently. This is a clear example of niche separation and helps to explain the coexistence of these species."

                        "en": "1 We compared allometric growth patterns. canopy structure and light interception for individual shoots of different species in a tall-grass meadow.\n2 The vertical distributions of above-ground biomass, leaf area, height and leaf angles were measured, both early and late in the season, for individual shoots of Miscanthus sinensis (the dominant species), Lespedeza bicolor, Lysimachia clethroides, Astilbe thunbergii and Potentilla freyniana. A canopy model was developed to calculate light absorption by individual shoots, Light absorption per unit mass (Phi(mass)) was used to quantify the efficiency with which plants utilized biomass to capture light.\n3 The leaf mass ratio (LMR), average specific leaf area (SLA) and therefore the leaf area ratio (LAR) decreased with shoot height and light availability. Light absorption per unit leaf area (Phi(area)) increased with shoot height, and this increase was observed to be much stronger at greater than at smaller shoot heights.\n4 In the taller species (Miscanthus and Lespedeza) Phi(mass) (the product of LAR and Phi(area)) increased, while in the shortest species (Potentilla) it decreased with shoot height. Clones of Miscanthus and Lespedeza may thus increase total light capture by allocating shoot biomass among fewer taller shoots, and a clone of Potentilla by producing a larger number of shorter shoots.\n5 Shoots of the shorter species were equally efficient in capturing light (i.e. they had similar Phi(mass)) early in the season, but less efficient later in the season than shoots of the taller species. Shorter species appear to be able to use the earlier part of the season for efficient light capturer while shoots of taller species gain an advantage from their height later in the season.\n6 This study shows how different above-ground growth patterns of the species in a tall-grass meadow allow them to use different positions in vertical space and different periods of the season to absorb light efficiently. This is a clear example of niche separation and helps to explain the coexistence of these species."

We focused on two processes, carboxylation and regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), which potentially limit photosynthetic rates, Because the former process is known to limit photosynthesis at lower CO2 concentrations while the latter limits it at higher CO2 concentrations, we determined the temperature dependence of the photosynthetic rate at 200 and 1000 mu L L-1 CO2 under saturated light. It was revealed that the temperature dependence of both processes varied depending on the growth temperature. Using a biochemical model, we estimated the capacity of the two processes at various temperatures under ambient CO2 concentration. It was suggested that, in leaves grown at low temperature (15 degrees C), the photosynthetic rate was limited solely by RuBP carboxylation under any temperature. On the other hand, it was suggested that, in leaves grown at high temperature (30 degrees C), the photosynthetic rate was limited by RuBP regeneration below 22 degrees C, but limited by RuBP carboxylation above 22 degrees C, We concluded that: (1) the changes in the temperature dependence of carboxylation and regeneration of RuBP and (2) the changes in the balance of these two processes altered the temperature dependence of the photosynthetic rate."

                        "en": "Patterns of above-ground biomass allocation and light capture by plants growing in dense stands or in isolation were studied in relation to their height. A canopy model was developed to calculate light absorption by individual plants. This model was combined with data on canopy structure and patterns of biomass allocation for solitary plants and for plants of different heights in dense mono-specific stands of the dicotyledonous annual Xanthium canadense Mill. There were four stands, and stand height increased with age and nutrient availability. The allometric relationship between height and mass differed considerably between plants in stands and those growing in isolation and also between plants of different heights within stands. The proportion of shoot mass in leaf laminae (LMR) decreased with increasing plant height, bur solitary plants had a higher LMR than competing plants of the same height. Thus, in contrast to previous assumptions, LMR of competing plants is not strictly determined by biomechanical constraints but results from a plastic shift in biomass allocation in response to competition. Average leaf area per unit leaf mass (SLA) decreased with increasing photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) independent of nutrient availability. Consequently, taller, more dominant plants in stands had a lower leaf area ratio (LAR: LAR = LMR x SLA) than shorter, more subordinate plants. Dominant plants absorbed more light both per unit leaf area (Phi(area)) and per unit mass (Phi(mass)) than subordinate plants. Their greater Phi(area) more than compensated for a lower LAR (Phi(mass) = Phi(area) x LAR). We conclude that the greater Phi(mass) of dominant plants is quantitative evidence that success in competing for light is disproportionately related to the size of the shoot (i.e, asymmetric competition). We know of no other study which has demonstrated this with quantitative estimates of light acquisition in relation to plant size. This result is contrasted with previous studies on multi-specific stands in which Phi(mass) of dominant and subordinate species is similar, and we discuss why light competition in mono-specific stands is asymmetric whereas it can be size-symmetric in multi-specific stands, with similar or greater LAI.

A canopy model was developed to calculate light absorption by individual plants. This model was combined with data on canopy structure and patterns of biomass allocation for solitary plants and for plants of different heights in dense mono-specific stands of the dicotyledonous annual Xanthium canadense Mill. There were four stands, and stand height increased with age and nutrient availability. The allometric relationship between height and mass differed considerably between plants in stands and those growing in isolation and also between plants of different heights within stands. The proportion of shoot mass in leaf laminae (LMR) decreased with increasing plant height, bur solitary plants had a higher LMR than competing plants of the same height. Thus, in contrast to previous assumptions, LMR of competing plants is not strictly determined by biomechanical constraints but results from a plastic shift in biomass allocation in response to competition. Average leaf area per unit leaf mass (SLA) decreased with increasing photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) independent of nutrient availability.

Likewise, if nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) is constant, canopy photosynthesis is proportional to the amount of total leaf nitrogen (LN) (CP = NUE x LN). We applied these concepts to monospecific and mixed (1:1) stands of annuals (Abutilon theophrasti and Ambrosia artemisiifolia) at two stages, established in an ambient (360 mu l l(-1)) or elevated (700 mu l l(-1)) CO2 atmosphere. In both CO2 concentrations, across the two species, daily canopy photosynthesis gave strong linear regressions with zero intercepts both against the number of absorbed photons and against total leaf nitrogen in the canopy. Doubling CO2 increased LUE by 20-80 % and NUE by 20-100 %. LUE tended to be higher in Ambrosia than in Abutilon, and also higher in the later stage of canopy development than in the younger stage. Interference by Abutilon increased the LUE of Ambrosia. On the other hand, NUE tended to be higher in Abutilon than in Ambrosia, and to be higher in younger than in later stages. Interference by Abutilon decreased the NUE of Ambrosia. Thus, there are trade-offs (negative correlations) between LUE and NUE, which result from differences in leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area and from differences in leaf area development in the canopy. LUE increased with increasing leaf nitrogen concentration, while NUE increased with increasing light availability in the canopy. (C) 1998 Annals of Botany Company."

We applied these concepts to monospecific and mixed (1:1) stands of annuals (Abutilon theophrasti and Ambrosia artemisiifolia) at two stages, established in an ambient (360 mu l l(-1)) or elevated (700 mu l l(-1)) CO2 atmosphere. In both CO2 concentrations, across the two species, daily canopy photosynthesis gave strong linear regressions with zero intercepts both against the number of absorbed photons and against total leaf nitrogen in the canopy. Doubling CO2 increased LUE by 20-80 % and NUE by 20-100 %. LUE tended to be higher in Ambrosia than in Abutilon, and also higher in the later stage of canopy development than in the younger stage. Interference by Abutilon increased the LUE of Ambrosia. On the other hand, NUE tended to be higher in Abutilon than in Ambrosia, and to be higher in younger than in later stages. Interference by Abutilon decreased the NUE of Ambrosia. Thus, there are trade-offs (negative correlations) between LUE and NUE, which result from differences in leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area and from differences in leaf area development in the canopy. LUE increased with increasing leaf nitrogen concentration, while NUE increased with increasing light availability in the canopy. (C) 1998 Annals of Botany Company."

                        "en": "Effects of changes in the organization of photosynthetic components on leaf photosynthesis under contrasting atmospheric CO2 conditions (35 and 70 Pa) are evaluated using an optimization model, in which the photosynthetic rate is limited either by the capacity of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) to consume ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) or by the capacity of RuBP regeneration. The nitrogen cost of photosynthetic components to carry out each process is calculated for the optimal partitioning of nitrogen among the components. The model predicts that nitrogen allocation to the components carrying out RuBP regeneration should be increased with reduction in allocation to RuBPCase to maximize daily photosynthesis at 70 Pa CO2. Al a temperature of 25 degrees C, doubling the current CO2 level increases daily photosynthesis by 60% with optimal reallocation of the nitrogen partitioning while the increase without reallocation of nitrogen is 40%. However, at lower growth irradiance, the advantage in daily photosynthesis due to the reallocation decreases with increasing nitrogen content. The ratio of photosynthesis at 70 Pa to that at 35 Pa increases with increasing temperature. The effects of CO2 levels on photosynthesis of a canopy in which nitrogen is optimally allocated among leaf layers are also examined. At 25 degrees C, canopy photosynthesis at the doubled CO2 level is predicted to increase 60 and 40% with and without the optimization of nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components, respectively. Doubling the CO2 level does not affect the optimal nitrogen distribution among leaf layers in the canopy irrespective of optimization of nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components.

                        "en": "Effects of changes in the organization of photosynthetic components on leaf photosynthesis under contrasting atmospheric CO2 conditions (35 and 70 Pa) are evaluated using an optimization model, in which the photosynthetic rate is limited either by the capacity of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) to consume ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) or by the capacity of RuBP regeneration. The nitrogen cost of photosynthetic components to carry out each process is calculated for the optimal partitioning of nitrogen among the components. The model predicts that nitrogen allocation to the components carrying out RuBP regeneration should be increased with reduction in allocation to RuBPCase to maximize daily photosynthesis at 70 Pa CO2. At a temperature of 25°C, doubling the current CO2 level increases daily photosynthesis by 60% with optimal reallocation of the nitrogen partitioning while the increase without reallocation of nitrogen is 40%. However, at lower growth irradiance, the advantage in daily photosynthesis due to the reallocation decreases with increasing nitrogen content. The ratio of photosynthesis at 70 Pa to that at 35 Pa increases with increasing temperature. The effects of CO2 levels on photosynthesis of a canopy in which nitrogen is optimally allocated among leaf layers are also examined. At 25°C, canopy photosynthesis at the doubled CO2 level is predicted to increase 60 and 40% with and without the optimization of nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components, respectively. Doubling the CO2 level does not affect the optimal nitrogen distribution among leaf layers in the canopy irrespective of optimization of nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components."

Photosynthetic characteristics of an annual herb, Chenopodium album, and an evergreen tree, Quercus myrsinaefolia, were compared to clarify causes of the difference in photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (photosynthetic capacity per unit nitrogen) between leaves of herbaceous and evergreen species. 2. When leaves with the same nitrogen content on an area basis were compared, photosynthetic capacity of C. album was twice as high as that of Q. myrsinaefolia. Gas-exchange measurements showed higher intercellular CO2 concentration in C. album. Biochemical analyses indicated larger allocation of nitrogen into ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, a key enzyme of photosynthesis, and higher specific activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase in C. album. However, these differences were not large. 3. Compositional deviation of 13C in leaves of the two species suggested that the drop of CO2 level between the intercellular space and the chloroplast was slightly largerin Q. myrsinaefolia when compared between the leaves with the same photosynthetic capacity. 4. It is concluded that the difference in photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency between C. album and Q. myrsinaefolia is not caused by a sole factor that is markedly different between the two species but by several factors each of which is slightly disadvantageous to Q. myrsinaefolia compared with C. album."
