                        "en": "The microwave spectra of 2-cyclohexen-1-one oxime and its deuterated (=NOD), species were observed in the frequency range from 8 to 40 GHz in the ground vibrational state. The rotational constants were determined to be A = 4399.83 (12), B = 1507.832(4), and C = 1166.821(6) MHz For normal species and A = 4400.10(34), B = 1454.06(2), and C = 1134.38 (1) MHz for deuterated species. The inertial defects (Delta I = I-c - I-n - I-b) of normal and deuterated species were determined to be - 16.907 (6) and - 16.909 (18) u angstrom(2), respectively. The Delta I value suggests a plausible molecular structure in which the NOH group and five carbon atoms of the cyclohexene ring are coplanar, but one of the carbon atoms deviates from this plane. The anti form was determined by comparing the observed and calculated rotational constants, Delta I and Delta E (relative energy). From the r(s) coordinates of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom, the OH bond was found to be at the trans position with respect to the C=N double bond. The structural parameters of the two bond lengths and three bond angles of anti form were adjusted to the six rotational constants observed. It was found that the bond angle of angle C(H-2)CN is much wider than that of angle C(H)CN by about 10 degrees. The rotational constants (B and C) of anti form calculated using MP2/6-31G (d, p) level were in good agreement with those observed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The rotational constants of two isomers of normal species were determined to be A = 27,093(15 1), B = 1270.656(8), and C = 1223.288(8) MHz for s-trans-(E) form and A = 12,239(19), B = 1587.49(2), and C= 1417.80(2) MHz for s-trans-(Z) form. The inertial defects (Delta I= I-c-I-a-I-b) of normal and deuterated species were determined to be - 3.25(11) and - 3.24(20) u angstrom(2) for s-trans-(E) form, and - 3.191(73) and - 3.180(36) u angstrom(2) for s-trans-(Z) form, respectively. From the r(s) coordinates of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom determined for s-trans-(E) and s-trans-(Z) forms, their OH bonds were concluded to be at the trans position with respect to the C=N double bond. For s-trans-(E) form, the C-3-C-4 torsional excited vibrational states were observed up to v = 3. The vibrational frequency was found to be 90(40) cm - 1 from the relative intensity measurement. The vibrational mode was nearly harmonic. The structural parameters of r(C-4=N), r(C-3-C-4), angle C3C4N and angle-C4NO for s-trans-(E) and s-trans-(Z) forms were adjusted separately to their rotational constants observed. It was found that the bond angle of angle C3C4N in s-trans-(Z) form are much wider than that in s-trans-(E) form by about 10 degrees. The rotational constants observed for s-trans-(E) and s-trans-(Z) forms were consistent with those calculated using MP2/6-31G(d,p) rather than 6-311 + +G(d,p) basis sets, and those (B and C) calculated for s-trans-(E) using MP2/6-31G(d,p) were in excellent agreement with those observed.

The rotational constants were determined to be A = 4399.83 (12), B = 1507.832(4), and C = 1166.821(6) MHz For normal species and A = 4400.10(34), B = 1454.06(2), and C = 1134.38 (1) MHz for deuterated species. The inertial defects (Delta I = I-c - I-n - I-b) of normal and deuterated species were determined to be - 16.907 (6) and - 16.909 (18) u angstrom(2), respectively. The Delta I value suggests a plausible molecular structure in which the NOH group and five carbon atoms of the cyclohexene ring are coplanar, but one of the carbon atoms deviates from this plane. The anti form was determined by comparing the observed and calculated rotational constants, Delta I and Delta E (relative energy). From the r(s) coordinates of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom, the OH bond was found to be at the trans position with respect to the C=N double bond. The structural parameters of the two bond lengths and three bond angles of anti form were adjusted to the six rotational constants observed. It was found that the bond angle of angle C(H-2)CN is much wider than that of angle C(H)CN by about 10 degrees. The rotational constants (B and C) of anti form calculated using MP2/6-31G (d, p) level were in good agreement with those observed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The rotational constants observed for s-trans-(E) and s-trans-(Z) forms were consistent with those calculated using MP2/6-31G(d,p) rather than 6-311 + +G(d,p) basis sets, and those (B and C) calculated for s-trans-(E) using MP2/6-31G(d,p) were in excellent agreement with those observed.

Only a-type R-branch transitions were assigned in the vibrational ground and excited states. The rotational constants of normal species were determined to be A = 5870.80(33), B = 1917.021(8), and C = 1526.784(8) MHz in the vibrational ground state, and A = 5870.16(43), B = 1842.707(9), and C = 1479.40](9) MHz for deuterated species. The dipole moments were determined as u(a) = 0. 80(10), mu(b) = 0.20(10), and mu(c) = 0.40(10) D. The ring-puckering vibrational states were observed up to v = 6. The vibrational mode was nearly harmonic. The fundamental frequency of the ring-puckering mode was found to be 70(20) cm(-1). The molecular structure of cyclopentatione oxime was determined to be a twisted configuration by comparing the observed and calculated rotational constants, planar moment of inertia, P-cc, and r(s) coordinates of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom. On the molecular geometry, the bond angle, ZC(2)C(1)N(6) (Fig. 1), is larger than angle C5C1N6 by ca. 6 degrees, because of the steric repulsion between the methylene group of C-2 atom and hydroxyl group.

Adding to normal species and CH3CH=NOD, the r(s) coordinates of H-1, N, C-1, C-2, and H-3 atoms (refer to Fig. 1) of (E) and (Z) isomers in A-state were calculated using Kraitchman's equation. The structural parameters, three bond lengths and three bond angles of (E)- and (Z)-acetaldehyde oxime in A-state were determined. The structural parameters obtained are as follows: for E isomer. r(C-1=N): 1.265(15) Angstrom, r(C-1-C-2): 1.510(11)Angstrom, r(C-1-H-1): 1.110(9) Angstrom, angleC(2)C(1)N: 117.7(8)degrees, angleH(1)C(1)N: 118.1(5)degrees, and angleC(2)C(1)H(1): 124.2(7)degrees, and for Z isomer, r(C-1=N): 1-275(4)Angstrom, r(C-1-C-2): 1.510(14) Angstrom, r(C-1-H-1): 1.091(8) Angstrom, angleC(2)C(1)N: 124.3(7)degrees, angleH(1)C(1)N: 113.6(5)degrees, and angleC(2)C(1)H(1): 122.1(7)degrees. The bond angle angleC(2)C(1)N in Z isomer is much larger than that of (E) isomer. because of the steric repulsion between the methyl and hydroxyl groups in (Z) isomer. The steric repulsion may be related to the low barrier height (V-3) of the methyl group in Z isomer. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

                        "en": "The spectroscopic constants of s-trans (E)-acrylaldehyde oxime of normal, CH2=CH-CH=NOH, and deuterated, CH2=CH-CH=NOD, species were refined by adding a-type R-branch transitions observed in the frequency range of 34-40 GHz in the ground vibrational state. For s-trans (Z) form, the spectroscopic constants of normal species were refined by refitting the reported frequencies with four b-type Q-branch transitions and those of deuterated species were determined by the least-squares fitting of the observed a-type R-branch transitions in the ground vibrational state. The spectroscopic constants of two isomers of normal species were also determined in the vibrationally excited states. The inertial defects (DeltaI = I-c - I-a - I-b) of normal and deuterated species were determined to be -0.042(24) and -0.064(17) u Angstrom(2) for s-trans (E)-1 form, and -0.0536(8) and -0.063(11) u Angstrom(2) for s-trans (Z)-1 form, respectively. From the r(s) coordinates of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom determined for s-trans (Z)-1 form, its OH bond was concluded to be at the trans position with respect to the C=N double bond. The dipole moments of deuterated species of s-trans (E)-1 form and those of normal and deuterated species of s-trans (Z)-1 form were determined. The structural parameters of r(C-2-C-3), &lt;C1C2C3, &lt;C2C3N, and &lt;C3NO for s-trans (E)-1 and s-trans (Z)-1 forms were adjusted separately using to their rotational constants observed. It was found that the bond angle of &lt;C2C3N in s-trans (Z)-1 form are much wider than that in s-trans (E)-1 form by about 10degrees. The difference between the observed and calculated (using MP2/6-311++G (d,p) level) rotational constants of s-trans (Z)-1 form was larger than that of s-trans (E)-1 form. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

                        "en": "syn-2-Nitrosopropene was generated, in the gas phase, by chemical reaction of 1-chloro-2-(hydroxyimino)propane with K2CO3 and identified by microwave spectroscopy. The microwave spectrum of the reaction product was observed in the frequency range from 8.0 to 40.0 GHz. The rotational constants (MHz) were determined as A = 8744.09(6), B = 4846.07(2), and C = 3177.84(3) for CH2=C(CH3)-(NO)-N-14 (normal species) and A = 8664.36(5), B = 4822.15(3), and C = 3157.04(3) for CH2=C(CH3)-(NO)-N-15 (N-15 species) in the ground vibrational state. The values of the planar moment (P-cc = (I-a + I-b - I-c)/2) obtained for the normal and N-15 species were 1.525(1) and 1.526(1) u Angstrom (2) respectively. This suggests that the nitrogen atom lies in or is close to the nb inertial plane of the molecule and shows also that only two hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically out of the symmetry plane. The reaction product was determined to be syn-2-nitrosopropene by comparing the observed and calculated rotational constants, kappa (Ray's asymmetry parameter) and r(s) coordinates of the nitrogen atom. The dipole moments (D) were determined to be mu (a) = 2.43(5), mu (b) = 1.12(7), and mu (total) = 2.67(7). The barrier heights of the internal rotation owing to the methyl group of the normal species in the ground and first excited torsional states were determined to be 1750(50) and 1740(50) cal/mol (1 cal/mol = 4.184 J/mol), respectively. The N-14 nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (MHz) were determined to be chi (aa) = 0.25(21), chi (bb) = -7.11(40), and chi (cc) = 6.85(61). Two vibrational excited states were observed and the vibrational frequencies (cm(-1)) of the C-N and C-C torsional modes were determined to be 160(40) and 175(40), respectively. The lifetime of syn-2-nitrosopropene was found to be ca. 2 min in the waveguide cell. (C) 2000 Academic Press."

                        "en": "syn-2-Nitrosopropene was generated, in the gas phase, by chemical reaction of 1-chloro-2-(hydroxyimino)propane with K2CO3 and identified by microwave spectroscopy. The microwave spectrum of the reaction product was observed in the frequency range from 8.0 to 40.0 GHz. The rotational constants (MHz) were determined as A = 8744.09(6), B = 4846.07(2), and C = 3177.84(3) for CH2=C(CH3)-(NO)-N-14 (normal species) and A = 8664.36(5), B = 4822.15(3), and C = 3157.04(3) for CH2=C(CH3)-(NO)-N-15 (N-15 species) in the ground vibrational state. The values of the planar moment (P-cc = (I-a + I-b - I-c)/2) obtained for the normal and N-15 species were 1.525(1) and 1.526(1) u Angstrom (2) respectively. This suggests that the nitrogen atom lies in or is close to the nb inertial plane of the molecule and shows also that only two hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically out of the symmetry plane. The reaction product was determined to be syn-2-nitrosopropene by comparing the observed and calculated rotational constants, kappa (Ray's asymmetry parameter) and r(s) coordinates of the nitrogen atom. The dipole moments (D) were determined to be mu (a) = 2.43(5), mu (b) = 1.12(7), and mu (total) = 2.67(7). The barrier heights of the internal rotation owing to the methyl group of the normal species in the ground and first excited torsional states were determined to be 1750(50) and 1740(50) cal/mol (1 cal/mol = 4.184 J/mol), respectively. The N-14 nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (MHz) were determined to be chi (aa) = 0.25(21), chi (bb) = -7.11(40), and chi (cc) = 6.85(61). Two vibrational excited states were observed and the vibrational frequencies (cm(-1)) of the C-N and C-C torsional modes were determined to be 160(40) and 175(40), respectively. The lifetime of syn-2-nitrosopropene was found to be ca. 2 min in the waveguide cell. (C) 2000 Academic Press."
