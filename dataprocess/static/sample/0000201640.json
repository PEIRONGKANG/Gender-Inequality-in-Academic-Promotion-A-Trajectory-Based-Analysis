                        "en": "New insights into the metabolic mechanisms of frailty are needed. This study aimed to identify serum metabolites linked to frailty phenotype and its component through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomic analysis among community-dwelling older individuals. An exploratory, cross-sectional case-control study. Setting and participants: The participants were recruited from the ''Otassha Study,'' a cohort study conducted in Itabashi Ward, Tokyo, targeting women aged 65 years and older. The study population included 39 frail and 76 robust individuals. Metabolomic analysis was performed using the GCMS-TQTM8040 NX system and the Smart Metabolites Database Ver.2 to explore the primary metabolite characteristic of a frailty state. Conditional logistic regression analysis was conducted with frailty as the outcome and with metabolites as exposures. Concentrations of seven metabolites, including caffeine, catechol, paraxanthine, niacinamide, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoic acid, daidzein, and cytosine were lower in the frail than in the robust individuals. Odds ratios [95% confidence intervals] for frailty by halving the value were significant for catechol (1.26 [1.00, 1.59]), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoic acid (1.28 [1.04, 1.58]), caffeine (1.37 [1.07, 1.75]), paraxanthine (1.18 [1.00, 1.39]), and daidzein (1.29 [1.02, 1.62]). Furthermore, distinct patterns of metabolites associated with specific frailty symptoms, such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and reduced physical activity, were identified, especially with 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoic acid and caffeine commonly associated with these components. Metabolomic analysis identified metabolites associated with frailty. In particular, low levels of caffeine, catechol, paraxanthine, niacinamide, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoate, daidzein, and cytosine contributed to frailty. These results provide new insights into the pathophysiology of frailty through metabolomic analysis."

                        "en": "While many studies have described the association between cognitive decline and eating habits, little attention has been paid to its association with cheese intake. In this epidemiological study of 1035 community-dwelling women aged ≥ 65, we investigated the association between intake/type of cheese and cognitive function. The anthropometry, functional ability, and the frequency of food intake, including cheese, were assessed. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function, and a score of 20-26 was operationally defined as mild cognitive decline. We found that the MMSE score was significantly different between the presence of cheese intake and not (cheese intake: 28.4 ± 1.9; non-cheese intake: 27.6 ± 2.4) and between those who consumed Camembert cheese and those who did not (Camembert cheese: 28.7 ± 1.4; others: 28.3 ± 2.0). After adjusting for confounders, multiple logistic regression identified four independent variables significantly associated with mild cognitive decline: Camembert cheese intake (odds ratio = 0.448, 95% confidence interval = 0.214-0.936), age, usual walking speed, and repetitive saliva swallowing test scores. Our results, while based on cross-sectional data from Japanese community-dwelling older women, identified the significant inverse association between Camembert cheese intake and mild cognitive decline."

                        "en": "We examined whether knee extensor muscle strength can predict the onset of depressive symptoms in older Japanese women living in Tokyo. A baseline comprehensive geriatric examination was conducted to evaluate isometric knee extensor muscle strength and depressive symptoms (using Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS]) in 2017-2019. A free of neurological disease participants received a series of follow-up examinations following an initial evaluation. A GDS score of ≥5 during follow-up marked the onset of depressive symptoms. A logistic regression model was established after adjustment of baseline GDS score for variables including age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, working status, hobbies, volunteering, years of education, and dietary variety. Of the 1845 recruited individuals, 1409 were eligible to be targeted for follow-up. Among them, 768 women provided two-year follow-up data and contributed the final analysis. After covariate adjustments, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for depressive symptoms were 0.68 (0.39, 1.20) and 0.48 (0.26, 0.91) for the middle and highest tertiles of muscle strength, respectively, using the lowest tertile as reference. A dose-response association between muscle strength and depression (p = 0.022) was identified. This study suggests an inverse dose-response relationship between knee extensor muscle strength and the onset of depressive symptoms in older Japanese women."

                        "en": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Serum markers capable of detecting mild levels of undernutrition, such as insufficient dietary protein intake (IDPI), have not been established among community-dwelling older adults. Although the serum albumin redox state, expressed as the ratio of reduced albumin (Alb) to total Alb (the reduced albumin ratio), has the potential to overcome this challenge, empirical epidemiological data are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the association between a serum reduced Alb ratio and dietary protein intake among community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: This study analyzed cross-sectional data from 1,005 community dwelling population (572 males and 433 females) aged 70-84 years who participated in the Itabashi Longitudinal Study on Aging. Exclusion criteria included participants with incomplete data, individuals with a history of kidney disease and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The dietary protein intake was estimated using validated food frequency questionnaires. The IDPI was defined as not meeting the level recommended by the Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (Men ≥60 g/day, Women ≥50 g/day). RESULTS: IDPI was observed in 14.1% of the study population. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, body weight and malnutrition showed that a serum reduced Alb ratio was significantly associated with IDPI (odds ratio = 0.962, 95% confidence interval = 0.926-0.999), whereas serum albumin concentration was not (odds ratio = 0.549, 95% confidence interval = 0.285-1.061). CONCLUSIONS: A serum reduced Alb ratio would be a useful indicator of protein insufficiency among community-dwelling older adults."

This study aims to evaluate the association between physical frailty and cognitive decline among community-dwelling older Japanese women. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in an urban area of Tokyo, Japan, involving community-dwelling older adults 65 years or older. Physical frailty was evaluated using the Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria, consisting of five components: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, slowness, and low activity. Participants were classified as robust, pre-frail, or frail based on the presence of one or more criteria. Cognitive decline was defined as at least a three-point decrease in the Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline. The association between physical frailty and cognitive decline was examined using binomial logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. The analysis yielded multivariable odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), with robust participants using as the reference group. RESULTS: A total of 2,122 individuals participated in the baseline survey, with 805 included in the analysis (mean age: 72.9 ± 5.1 years). At baseline, 363 participants were classified as pre-frail, while 32 were classified as frail. During the two-year follow-up period, 68 participants experienced cognitive decline. The multivariable OR (95 % CI) for frailty, using robust as the reference, was 3.50 (1.13, 10.80). Furthermore, a linear relationship was observed between physical frailty and cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Among older Japanese women, there exists a dose-response relationship between physical frailty status and cognitive decline."

Their feasibility and acceptability, alongside impacts on frailty phenotype scores and step counts among older adults with frailty, remain to be fully validated. This study presents a 13-week preliminary intervention trial assessing an mHealth app's feasibility in a cohort of 34 eligible older adults, including 5 frail and 29 pre-frail participants. The intervention entailed a 6-week course on app usage, followed by 7 weeks of observation, with four participants withdrawing early. Feasibility was determined by login and active use rates, with a target login rate of 60% or higher. Post-intervention, 100% session attendance and a median login rate of 88.4% were observed. Acceptability was high, with 73% affirming the app's health benefits. Notably, frailty scores and step counts improved post-intervention, underscoring the app's potential for supporting older adults with frailty."

                        "en": "Smartwatches (SW) are wearable devices that support daily life and monitor an individual’s health and activity status. This information is utilized to promote behavior modification, which could help prevent chronic diseases and manage the health of older adults. Despite being interested in SWs, older adults tend to decrease their SW usage as they age. Therefore, understanding the acceptance of SWs among older individuals can facilitate individual health management through digital health technology. This study investigated the factors associated with the acceptance of SWs among older adults in Japan and the variations in the factors by sex. This study utilized data from the 2022 Itabashi Longitudinal Study on Aging, an ongoing cohort study conducted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology. We included 899 eligible individuals aged ≥65 years. Participants were classified into three groups: possessing SW (possessor group), not possessing SW but interested in possession in the future (interest group), and not interested in possession in the future (non-interest group) using a self-administered questionnaire. The level of SW acceptance was operationally defined as follows: low (non-interest group), medium (interest group), and high (possessor group). Further, we evaluated the association of acceptance and purchase intentions of SWs with sociodemographic variables, technology literacy, and health variables. Among the participants, 4.2% possessed SWs, with no significant sex difference (men, 4.2%; women, 4.3%). Among men, age &amp;lt; 75 years, obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were significantly associated with SW acceptance level. Contrastingly, among women, age &amp;lt; 75 years, living alone, higher household income, and a high score for new device use in the technology literacy category were significantly associated with SW acceptance level. Health-related factors were associated with SW acceptance in men, while technology literacy and sociodemographic factors were associated with SW acceptance in women. Our findings may inform the development of sex-specific interventions and policies for increasing SW utilization among older adults in Japan."

This study aimed to examine the association between polypharmacy and frailty severity or frailty phenotypes in community-dwelling older Japanese adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1021 older adults from the Itabashi Longitudinal Study on Aging. Men accounted for 45.4%, and the mean age (standard deviation) was 77.9 (5.1) years. Participants were classified into frail (n = 67), pre-frail (n = 543), and robust (n = 411) groups using the revised Japanese Cardiovascular Health Study criteria. Polypharmacy was defined as using five or more self-reported prescription drugs. Ordinal and binomial logistic regression analyses examined the association between polypharmacy and frailty severity or frailty phenotypes (weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, slowness, and low activity). These models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, number of comorbidities, living status, employment status, years of education, as well as drinking and smoking habits. RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in participants with and without polypharmacy was 10.1% and 5.0%, respectively. Participants with polypharmacy were more likely to have frailty (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.89 [1.40-2.57]), weight loss (1.81 [1.00-3.27]), weakness (1.50 [1.08-2.09]), and slowness (2.25 [1.29-3.94]) compared with the no-polypharmacy group. CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy was associated with frailty severity and three frailty phenotypes. Longitudinal studies are required to investigate whether polypharmacy can predict the development and progression of frailty. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2024; ••: ••-••."

                        "en": "AIM: Muscle mass and strength correlate with cognitive function; however, it remains unclear whether dynapenia (i.e., muscle weakness with preserved muscle mass) is relevant. This study aimed to explore whether dynapenia is associated with global cognitive function in community-dwelling older Japanese adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the Integrated Research Initiative for Living Well with Dementia Cohort Study, which pooled data from five community-based geriatric cohorts. Dynapenia was defined as muscle weakness without muscle mass loss according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). An ordered logistic regression analysis was conducted with dynapenia as the exposure and with cognitive decline stages, defined as an MMSE score of 27-30 for normal cognition, 24-26 for possible cognitive decline, and <24 for cognitive decline, as the outcome, stratified by sex and adjusted for age, muscle mass, education, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, living alone, and non-communicable diseases. RESULTS: We analyzed data for 3338 participants (2162 female) with preserved muscle mass. Of these, 449 (13.5%) had dynapenia, and 79 (2.4%) exhibited cognitive decline. Multivariate odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for cognitive decline among those with dynapenia, compared with those without dynapenia, were 1.51 (1.02-2.24) for males and 2.08 (1.51-2.86) for females. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle weakness is associated with cognitive decline, even in individuals with preserved muscle mass. Further studies are needed to better understand the association between muscle weakness and cognitive decline over time in order to develop dementia prevention strategies for those with dynapenia.

                        "en": "AIM: The Questionnaire for Medical Checkup of Old-Old (QMCOO) is a 15-item dichotomous questionnaire developed for the early detection and intervention of frailty in a nationwide health checkup program targeting the old-old (i.e. aged ≥75 years). The Kihon Checklist (KCL) is a 25-item questionnaire widely used for screening and self-monitoring frailty status in administrative settings. With fewer items than the KCL, the QMCOO might expedite the frailty screening process. This study tested whether the QMCOO shows noninferiority in detecting frailty compared with the KCL. METHODS: Overall, 645 participants aged ≥75 years in the Itabashi Longitudinal Study on Aging were assessed for their frailty status according to the revised Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria. They also completed the QMCOO and the KCL simultaneously. We compared the discriminative performance of the two questionnaires using non-inferiority testing with an operationally defined non-inferiority margin of 10% of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve computed from the KCL. RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty was 8.8%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the QMCOO in determining frailty was 0.76 (95% CI 0.70, 0.82), and the corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the KCL was 0.77 (95% CI 0.69, 0.84). The QMCOO was not inferior to the KCL for frailty discrimination (P for non-inferiority = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the QMCOO for determining frailty was not inferior to that of the KCL. The QMCOO might be more acceptable and useful, as it can be applied in a shorter time with fewer questions than the KCL. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2023; ••: ••-••."

                        "en": "INTRODUCTION: Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin discovered as an essential factor for blood coagulation. It is suggested that vitamin K can benefit several aging-related diseases, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and dementia. We previously reported the cross-sectional association of vitamin K insufficiency with frailty in community-dwelling older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In October 2020, a health examination of community-dwelling older adults (The Otassha Study) was performed, including frailty evaluation and blood tests. We used a ucOC and OC ratio (ucOC/OC) to indicate vitamin K insufficiency. One year later, we conducted a follow-up evaluation of frailty on 518 people who were not frail at baseline. The serum ucOC/OC at the baseline examination was divided into quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using multivariate binary logistic regression for each quartile of ucOC/OC to determine the risk of incident frailty in the follow-up study, with the lowest quartile (Q1) as the reference. RESULTS: Among the 518 older adults who were not frail at baseline, 66 people (12.7%) became frail in the follow-up study. In the multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, setting the lowest quartile of ucOC/OC (Q1) as a reference, the OR of the incident frailty in the highest quartile (Q4) was 2.53 (95% CI 1.07, 4.92) which was significantly different from Q1. CONCLUSION: The findings of this longitudinal study suggest that vitamin K insufficiency has nutritional importance in predicting the future incidence of frailty in the Japanese older adult population."

                        "en": "Diet modification may contribute to the prevention of age-related cognitive decline. The association between dairy product consumption and cognitive function in older people remains unknown. We investigated whether cheese intake is associated with lower cognitive function (LCF) in community-dwelling older adults. This cross-sectional study included 1503 adults aged over 65 years. The analyzed data were obtained through face-to-face interviews and functional ability measurement. Cognitive function was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and a score ≤23 was defined as LCF. The prevalence of LCF was 4.6%, and this group had smaller calf circumference, slower usual walking speed, and a more frequent history of anemia than subjects with MMSE scores >23. After adjusting for confounding factors, logistic regression analysis revealed cheese intake (odds ratio (OR) = 0.404, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.198-0.824), age (OR = 1.170, 95% CI = 1.089-1.256), usual walking speed (OR = 0.171, 95% CI = 0.062-0.472) and calf circumference (OR = 0.823, 95% CI = 0.747-0.908) to be significant factors associated with LCF. Although the present study was an analysis of cross-sectional data of Japanese community-dwelling older adults, the results suggest that cheese intake is inversely associated with LCF."

                        "en": "INTRODUCTION: This study examined whether the association between sarcopenia severity and cognitive function differed according to sex and age in community-dwelling older adults in Japan. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of older adults (age ≥ 65 years) consisting of five regional cohorts integrated as the Integrated Research Initiative for Living Well with Dementia (IRIDE) Cohort Study. Sarcopenia severity was determined based on the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019, which assessed grip strength, walking speed, and skeletal muscle mass index. Poor cognitive function was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination score of ≤ 23. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for poor cognitive function were calculated by sex and age group (65-74 and ≥75 years) using binomial logistic regression models, which were adjusted for age, educational attainment, history of non-communicable diseases, smoking and drinking habits, living alone, frequency of going outdoors, exercise habits, and depressive symptom. RESULTS: Of the 8,180 participants, 6,426 (1,157 men aged 65-74 and 1,063 men aged 75 or older; 2,281 women aged 65-74 and 1,925 women aged 75 or older) were analyzed. The prevalence ratio of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia were 309 (13.9%) and 92 (4.1%) among men and 559 (13.3%) and 166 (3.7%) among women, respectively. A total of 127 (5.8%) men and 161 (3.9%) women had a poor cognitive function. Setting non-sarcopenia as a reference, the adjusted ORs (95% CI) of poor cognitive function were 2.20 (1.54, 3.15) for sarcopenia and 3.56 (2.20, 5.71) for severe sarcopenia. A similar trend was observed in analyses stratified by sex and age, with linear associations (P for trend <0.05) in both categories. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction (P < 0.05) between sex and sarcopenia severity, indicating a stronger linear association of sarcopenia severity with poor cognitive function in women compared with men. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia severity was linearly associated with poor cognitive function in adults aged ≥ 65 years, with a stronger association in women compared with men."

                        "en": "AIM: Radio-Taiso, a traditional exercise program in Japan, may serve as a coping strategy for older adults with frailty during the COVID-19 pandemic. This phase II trial tested program adherence and safety and explored the potential effectiveness of a home-based Radio-Taiso. METHODS: This assessor-blind parallel randomized controlled trial included community-dwelling Jolder Japanese adults with frailty and pre-frailty. Fifty-eight eligible participants were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. Intervention participants performed 3-5-min sessions of Radio-Taiso one to four times per day for 12 weeks. Feasibility criteria were set at practice and retention rates of ≥75%. Safety was monitored by assessing all adverse events reported by participants during the intervention period, irrespective of causality. Potential effectiveness was exploratorily assessed using items that allow clinical interpretation of changes: mobility and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), assessed using the modified short physical performance battery (SPPB) and the SF-36, respectively. RESULTS: Both practice (83%) and retention rates (100%) met the predetermined feasibility criteria. Eleven adverse events were reported but were supposedly unrelated to the intervention. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no clinically significant difference in the change in SPPB score between groups (-0.4 points, 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.2, 0.3); however, the intervention group scored higher in the mental component of HR-QoL than did the control group (3.4 points, 95% CI: -1.1, 7.8). CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary data indicate that a phase III trial is feasible, focusing on the mental aspect of HR-QoL as the primary outcome. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; ••: ••-••."

[Subjects] Subjects were 170 elderly persons who participated in an exercise program for frailties. [Methods] Walking abilities, balance functions, and muscle functions of the lower and upper extremities were assessed. We evaluated relationships between physical functions and psychological factors such as Health-related Quality of Life (HR-QOL), falls self-efficacy and so on by partial correlation coefficient analysis. [Results] Some physical functions showed significant relationships with psychological factors, but those relations were moderate or weak. [Conclusion] Although we supposed that there were some relations between physical and psychological functions, a more multiphasic evaluation might be needed to produce more conclusive evidence. © 2014 by the Society of Physical Therapy Science.",

                        "en": "Concerning the health care for paraplegic patients, many devices were developed to assist paraplegic walk, but such trials had fallen short of paraplegic's desire. A new concept of reciprocal walking orthosis has been developed to restore the locomotor function. A complete paraplegia achieved a maximun walking speed of 34.1m/min, and the distance of 52 Im. The EMG responses in paralyzed muscles were observed while walking. The pattern of rhythm and amplitude of the EMG responses were examined. Synchronized EMG responses were obtained in tibialis anterior and soleus corresponding to the reciprocal motion of hip joint. Considering the big force at the kick off and heel strike, that wilt estimate 130% of body weight, the reciprocal EMG responses seems to support Dietz's hypothesis that the load effect activates the reforming of central pattern generator (CPG). But the pattern was not neccesarily observed in any walking rest, so unknown parameters other than the mechanical stimulations, which control the output of activities of CPG, should be persuaded by further investigation."
