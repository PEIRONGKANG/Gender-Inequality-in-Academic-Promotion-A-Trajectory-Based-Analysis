                        "en": "The relationship between the polyol pathway and sugar cataracts has been studied extensively using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and galactose fed rats as animal models for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). In these models, sugar cataracts progress quickly, leading to rapid lenticular polyol accumulation in the early stages of cataract formation, In 1992, a new animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, was established. In the present study, we examined both biochemical and morphological changes in the lenses of the OLETF rats to determine whether these changes reflect those associated with diabetic cataract formation and to clarify their relationship with the polyol pathway. For the biochemical analysis, we measured the enzyme activity of aldose reductase (AR) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) and the sorbitol levels using 20, 40 and 60 week old OLETF or control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats, Enzyme activities of AR and SDH, which were lower in 20 week old OLETF rats than in LETO rats, were increased in 60 week old OLETF rats. The lenticular sorbitol level of the OLETF rats was similar to the control level at 20 weeks of age, but it was markedly increased at 40 weeks of age, and slightly decreased at 60 weeks of age compared with rats at 40 weeks but not compared with controls. Slight lens fiber swelling was observed in the anterior and/or posterior subcapsular regions of 40 week old OLETF rats, accompanying elevated sorbitol level and slightly increased SDH activity in the lens. Swelling and liquefaction of lens fibers were observed in the subcapsular and supranuclear region of 60 week old OLETF rats, as well as decreased lenticular sorbitol, and markedly increased SDH activity compared with rats at 40 weeks. AR activity was also increased causing the elevation of sorbitol in lenses of OLETF rats during the early stages of cataract formation. Despite differences in the etiology of diabetes mellitus, the strain of rat and the rate of disease progression in the OLETF rat model compared with other diabetic models, the present results support the theory that the polyol pathway via AR is a factor in the development of sugar cataracts, (C) 2001 Academic Press."

                        "en": "The relationship between the polyol pathway and sugar cataracts has been studied extensively using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and galactose fed rats as animal models for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). In these models, sugar cataracts progress quickly, leading to rapid lenticular polyol accumulation in the early stages of cataract formation, In 1992, a new animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, was established. In the present study, we examined both biochemical and morphological changes in the lenses of the OLETF rats to determine whether these changes reflect those associated with diabetic cataract formation and to clarify their relationship with the polyol pathway. For the biochemical analysis, we measured the enzyme activity of aldose reductase (AR) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) and the sorbitol levels using 20, 40 and 60 week old OLETF or control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats, Enzyme activities of AR and SDH, which were lower in 20 week old OLETF rats than in LETO rats, were increased in 60 week old OLETF rats. The lenticular sorbitol level of the OLETF rats was similar to the control level at 20 weeks of age, but it was markedly increased at 40 weeks of age, and slightly decreased at 60 weeks of age compared with rats at 40 weeks but not compared with controls. Slight lens fiber swelling was observed in the anterior and/or posterior subcapsular regions of 40 week old OLETF rats, accompanying elevated sorbitol level and slightly increased SDH activity in the lens. Swelling and liquefaction of lens fibers were observed in the subcapsular and supranuclear region of 60 week old OLETF rats, as well as decreased lenticular sorbitol, and markedly increased SDH activity compared with rats at 40 weeks. AR activity was also increased causing the elevation of sorbitol in lenses of OLETF rats during the early stages of cataract formation. Despite differences in the etiology of diabetes mellitus, the strain of rat and the rate of disease progression in the OLETF rat model compared with other diabetic models, the present results support the theory that the polyol pathway via AR is a factor in the development of sugar cataracts, (C) 2001 Academic Press."

The expressions of AR and SDH mRNAs in Schwann cells were unaltered by high (30 mM) glucose content in the medium. On the other hand, osmotic stress elicited significant increases in AR mRNA without any effect on SDH mRNA expression. The levels of AR mRNA determined by this RT-PCR system were significantly correlated with AR activity, as well as the levels of sorbitol accumulated in Schwann cells cultured under hyperosmotic conditions. These findings suggest that in contrast to the induction of AR expression by osmotic stress, high glucose per se does not up-regulate expression of the enzymes constituting the polyol pathway in Schwann cells. The RT-PCR system developed in this study may be a useful tool in ascertaining the relative contributions of AR and SDH to the metabolic derangements leading to diabetic complications. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V."

                        "en": "To investigate the polyol pathway activity in Schwann cells, we determined the mRNA levels of aldose reductase (AR) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) in cultured cells under hyperglycemic or hyperosmotic conditions using competitive RT-PCR technique. The expressions of AR and SDH mRNAs in Schwann cells were unaltered by high (30 mM) glucose content in the medium. On the other hand, osmotic stress elicited significant increases in AR mRNA without any effect on SDH mRNA expression. The levels of AR mRNA determined by this RT-PCR system were significantly correlated with AR activity, as well as the levels of sorbitol accumulated in Schwann cells cultured under hyperosmotic conditions. These findings suggest that in contrast to the induction of AR expression by osmotic stress, high glucose per se does not up-regulate expression of the enzymes constituting the polyol pathway in Schwann cells. The RT-PCR system developed in this study may be a useful tool in ascertaining the relative contributions of AR and SDH to the metabolic derangements leading to diabetic complications. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V."

                        "en": "We have recently shown that sphingomyelin (SM) strongly inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated lipolysis in monolayers and emulsion particles. To further evaluate how SM modulates LPL activity on the emulsion surface, the relationship between membrane surface structure and LPL activity was investigated. We measured fluorescence anisotropy of 1-palmitoyl-2-[3- (diphenylhexatrienyl)propionyl]-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine, probing surface acyl chain fluidity, and fluorescence lifetime of N-(5- dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine in H2O and D2O buffer, assessing the degree of hydration in the head group region. The results revealed that incorporation of egg SM into triolein-egg phosphatidylcholine emulsions markedly increased acyl chain order and decreased head group hydration of the surface monolayers. In contrast, cholesterol was shown to increase head group hydration despite a strong increase in acyl chain order. The close correlation between the apparent K(m) values of LPL and the degree of head group hydration indicated that LPL interacts with the head group region rather than with the hydrophobic interior of the surface monolayers. However, apparent V(max) did not show a simple correlation with any surface structure, and the finding in which SM had no effect on apparent V(max) of medium-chain triglyceride emulsions suggested that the hydrophobic interaction between acyl chains of SM and triglyceride at the emulsion surface is important for determining the apparent V(max). These results showed conclusively that SM inhibits LPL activity mainly by changing the emulsion surface structure and not by a specific interaction between SM and LPL. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V."

                        "en": "A two-site immunoassay system for evaluating tissue levels of aldose reductase was developed using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to the recombinant human enzyme expressed in a baculovirus system. The calibration graph of this system was linear for concentrations of aldose reductase ranging from 0 to 16ngml-1. The detection limit was 0.034ngml-1. The coefficients of variation within and between assays were 3.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Analytical recovery was 101-106%. The amount of aldose reductase expressed in human tissues was measured by this system. Higher levels of aldose reductase were found in kidney medulla, sciatic nerve and lens indicating that the enzyme level was higher in the target organs of diabetic complications. The aldose reductase level of sciatic nerve was well correlated with that of erythrocytes (r=0.62, p&lt\n0.05). When erythrocyte aldose reductase was determined in 160 patients with a diabetic duration for less than 10 years, the enzyme level in patients with neuropathy was significantly higher than in those without any complications. The incidence of neuropathy in these patients was significantly increased in proportion to the enzyme levels (p&lt\n0.05). In this study, it has become apparent that the aldose reductase level in erythrocytes of patients with short diabetic duration (&lt\n10 years) is associated with the presence of neuropathy. It was also suggested that the immunoassay system will provide useful clinical information to optimize administration of aldose reductase inhibitors for effective prevention and treatment of diabetic complications.

                        "en": "A two-site immunoassay system for evaluating tissue levels of aldose reductase was developed using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to the recombinant human enzyme expressed in a baculovirus system. The calibration graph of this system was linear for concentrations of aldose reductase ranging from 0 to 16ngml-1. The detection limit was 0.034ngml-1. The coefficients of variation within and between assays were 3.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Analytical recovery was 101-106%. The amount of aldose reductase expressed in human tissues was measured by this system. Higher levels of aldose reductase were found in kidney medulla, sciatic nerve and lens indicating that the enzyme level was higher in the target organs of diabetic complications. The aldose reductase level of sciatic nerve was well correlated with that of erythrocytes (r=0.62, p&lt\n0.05). When erythrocyte aldose reductase was determined in 160 patients with a diabetic duration for less than 10 years, the enzyme level in patients with neuropathy was significantly higher than in those without any complications. The incidence of neuropathy in these patients was significantly increased in proportion to the enzyme levels (p&lt\n0.05). In this study, it has become apparent that the aldose reductase level in erythrocytes of patients with short diabetic duration (&lt\n10 years) is associated with the presence of neuropathy. It was also suggested that the immunoassay system will provide useful clinical information to optimize administration of aldose reductase inhibitors for effective prevention and treatment of diabetic complications.
