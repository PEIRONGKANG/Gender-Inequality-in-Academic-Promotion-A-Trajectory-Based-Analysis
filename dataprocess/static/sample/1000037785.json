                        "en": "The rDNA of eukaryotic organisms is transcribed as the 40S-45S rRNA precursor, and this precursor contains the following segments: 5'-ETS-18S rRNA-ITS 1-5.8S rRNA - ITS 2 - 28S rRNA - 3'. In amphibians, the nucleotide sequences of the rRNA precursor have been completely determined in only two species of Xenopus. In the other amphibian species investigated so far, only the short nucleotide sequences of some rDNA fragments have been reported. We obtained a genomic clone containing the rDNA precursor from the Japanese pond frog Rana nigromaculata and analyzed its nucleotide sequence. The cloned genomic fragment was 4,806 bp long and included the T-terminus of 18S rRNA, ITS 1, 5.8S rRNA, ITS 2, and a long portion of 28S rRNA. A comparison of nucleotide sequences among Rana, the two species of Xenopus, and human revealed the following: (1) The T-terminus of 18S rRNA and the complete 5.8S rRNA were highly conserved among these four taxa. (2) The regions corresponding to the stem and loop of the secondary structure in 28S rRNA were conserved between Xenopus and Rana, but the rate of substitutions in the loop was higher than that in the stem. Many of the human loop regions had large insertions not seen in amphibians. (3) Two ITS regions had highly diverged sequences that made it difficult to compare the sequences not only between human and frogs, but also between Xenopus and Rana. (4) The short tracts in the ITS regions were strictly conserved between the two Xenopus species, and there was a corresponding sequence for Rana. Our data on the nucleotide sequence of the rRNA precursor from the Japanese pond frog Rana nigromaculata were used to examine the potential usefulness of the rRNA genes and ITS regions for evolutionary studies on frogs, because the rRNA precursor contains both highly conserved regions and rapidly evolving regions."

                        "en": "The rice frog Rana limnocharis is widely distributed in Southeast Asia and the rest of the Asian region extending from India to Japan. In Japan, the Sakishima-island populations of this species were regarded as a distinct species based on morphological and genetic divergences. The main purposes of this study were to confirm the presence of intraspecific reproductively isolating mechanisms in the Sakishima-island populations of R. limnocharis, and to clarify molecular inter- and intraspecific relationships of R. limnocharis and an allied species, Rana cancrivora. The hybridization experiments revealed that there were no reproductively isolating mechanisms between the Sakishima-island populations and other populations of R. limnocharis. The molecular evolutionary relationships were investigated by analyzing nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes using 12 populations of R. limnocharis from Japan and Taiwan, and two populations of R. cancrivora from Thailand and the Philippines. The phylogenetic trees constructed by the NJ method showed that the two populations of R. cancrivora were clearly separated from the 12 populations of R. limnocharis, and that the 12 populations of R. limnocharis were broadly divided into three clades; the first comprising eight populations from the main islands of Japan, the second comprising the Sakishima-island populations, and the third comprising the Okinawa-island and Taiwan populations. Interestingly, the Okinawa-island and Taiwan populations of R. limnocharis showed a close relationship that possibly reflected a secondary contact between the two populations. Based on the present crossing experiments and molecular data, it seems reasonable to regard the Sakishima-island populations as a single subspecies of R. limnocharis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The gene content, base composition, and codon usage of the Japanese pond frog conformed to those of typical vertebrate patterns. However, the comparison of gene organization between three amphibian species (Rana, Xenopus and caecilian) provided evidence that the gene arrangement of Rana differs by four tRNA gene positions from that of Xenopus or caecilian, a common gene arrangement in vertebrates. These gene rearrangements are presumed to have occurred by the tandem duplication of a gene region followed by multiple deletions of redundant genes. It is probable that the rearrangements start and end at tRNA genes involved in the initial production of a tandemly duplicated gene region. Putative secondary structures for the 22 tRNAs and the origin of the L-strand replication (O-L) are described. Evolutionary relationships were estimated from the concatenated sequences of the 12 proteins encoded in the H-strand of mtDNA among 37 vertebrate species.

                        "en": "To elucidate the potential of electrophoretic analysis for understanding relationships among microhylid frogs in Papua New Guinea, an allozyme analysis was conducted. A total of 119 individuals from nine species of Cophixalus, two species of Sphenophryne and one species of Barygenys, all of which belong to the family Microhylidae, were studied. Fourteen enzymes extracted from skeletal muscles and livers were analyzed by starch-gel electrophoresis. These enzymes were encoded by genes at 20 loci. There were 2-15 phenotypes produced by 2-12 alleles at these loci. The mean proportion of heterozygous loci per individual, mean proportion of polymorphic loci per population, and mean number of alleles per locus in 12 species were 6.1%, 17.1% and 1.17a on average, respectively. The NJ and ML trees constructed from Nei&apos;s genetic distances showed that the genus Sphenophryne can be distinguished biochemically from Cophixalus and Barygenys, and that the species groups of Cophixalus, which are similar in external morphology, can be divided biochemically into several species.

                        "en": "To elucidate the potential of electrophoretic analysis for understanding relationships among microhylid frogs in Papua New Guinea, an allozyme analysis was conducted. A total of 119 individuals from nine species of Cophixalus, two species of Sphenophryne and one species of Barygenys, all of which belong to the family Microhylidae, were studied. Fourteen enzymes extracted from skeletal muscles and livers were analyzed by starch-gel electrophoresis. These enzymes were encoded by genes at 20 loci. There were 2-15 phenotypes produced by 2-12 alleles at these loci. The mean proportion of heterozygous loci per individual, mean proportion of polymorphic loci per population, and mean number of alleles per locus in 12 species were 6.1%, 17.1% and 1.17a on average, respectively. The NJ and ML trees constructed from Nei&apos;s genetic distances showed that the genus Sphenophryne can be distinguished biochemically from Cophixalus and Barygenys, and that the species groups of Cophixalus, which are similar in external morphology, can be divided biochemically into several species.

The nucleotide sequences of a 412-bp segment of the 12S rRNA gene and a 534-bp segment of the cyt b gene were determined by the PCR-direct sequencing method using 19 frogs belonging to six species and one subspecies distributed in the Palearctic region. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood methods using Rana catesbeiana or Xenopus laevis as an outgroup. The 412-bp segment of the 12S rRNA gene contained 65 variable sites including gap sites, and the 534-bp segment of the cyt b gene contained 160 variable sites. The nucleotide sequence divergences of the 12S rRNA gene were 0.25-4.83% within the Far Eastern frogs, 0.25-6.22% within the European frogs, and 8.74-11.24% between the Far Eastern and the European frogs, whereas those of the cyt b gene were 3.64-14.73% within the Far Eastern frogs, 0.38-14.42% within the European frogs, and 16.53-23.58% between the Far Eastern and the European frogs. Although most nucleotide substitutions were at the third codon position of the cyt b gene and were silent mutations, 4 amino acid replacements occurred within the Far Eastern frogs, 4 within the European frogs, and 11 between the Far Eastern and the European frogs. The phylogenetic trees constructed fi om the nucleotide sequence divergences showed slightly different topologies for the 12S rRNA and cyt b genes. R. esculenta from Ukraine was closely related to R. lessonae from Luxembourg in both the 12S rRNA and the cyt b gene sequences. (C) 2000 Academic Press."

The phylogenetic trees constructed fi om the nucleotide sequence divergences showed slightly different topologies for the 12S rRNA and cyt b genes. R. esculenta from Ukraine was closely related to R. lessonae from Luxembourg in both the 12S rRNA and the cyt b gene sequences. (C) 2000 Academic Press."

The frogs belonged to two species, one subspecies, and one local race. The gene arrangements adjacent to the D-loop region were analyzed. The frogs shared a unique mitochondrial gene order that was found in Rana catesbeiana; i.e., cyt b - D-loop region - tRNA(Leu(CUN)) tRNA(Thr) - tRNA(Pro) - tRNA(Phe) 12S rRNA. The arrangements of the three tRNA genes of these frogs were different from those of X. laevis, a species which has the same overall structure as in mammals. Highly repetitive sequences with repeat units (16-bp or 17-bp sequence specific for each taxon) were found in the D-loop region. The length of repetitive sequences varied from 0.6 kbp to 1.2 kbp, and caused the extensive size variation in mtDNA. Several short sequence elements such as putative TAS, OH, CSB-1, and CSB-2 were found in the D-loop region of these frogs. The sequences of these short regulatory elements were conserved in R, catesbeiana, X. laevis, and also in human. The comparison of sequence divergences of the D-loop region and its adjacent genes among various taxa revealed that the rates of nucleotide substitutions depend on genes.
