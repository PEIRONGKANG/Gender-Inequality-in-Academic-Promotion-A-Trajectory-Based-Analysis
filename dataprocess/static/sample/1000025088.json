Then the control input to cart is determined so that actual acceleration of cart may follow the desired signal. The controller thus designed was shown to expand the range of initial angle from which the system can be stabilized.<br>In this paper, the generalization of the previous method was investigated based on Potential function. With the proposed method, the range of initial angle from which stabilization is possible is made larger, and, at the same time, the required input amplitude may be made smaller.

The controllers are selected from among two-degree-of-freedom robust-tracking controllers, and we derive the parametrization of all input/output deadbeat controllers. This parametrization is given by solving two polynomial Diophantine equations. We also derive the parametrization of all references for which input/output deadbeat response is maintained. In addition, we investigate the conditions for the processes under which the output deadbeat always implies the input deadbeat."

We also give the parametrization of all reference functions for which the robust tracking and designed deadbeat property is guaranteed by all robust-tracking deadbeat controllers for one reference. The solution to the robust-tracking deadbeat problem for more than two reference functions is also given. We use the H∞-norm of the sensitivity function as the robustness index of the system. By using two-degree-of-freedom control systems, we can achieve both minimal-time deadbeat control and optimal robustness with only one controller. © 1992 Taylor &amp\n Francis Ltd."
